Extends [**Dialog**](doc:dialog)

The PinDialog node class is a special type of Dialog node that prompts the user to enter a numeric string. The PinDialog node class includes an internal [PinPad](doc:pinpad) node to allow the user to input a numeric value, such as a PIN.

The PinDialog node class allows you to add a title (by setting the Dialog node title field), a message (by setting the Dialog node message field), and a set of action buttons (by setting the Dialog node buttons field). The bulletText and graphicUrl fields of the Dialog node should not be set. If those fields are set, the layout of the PinDialog node will likely not look correct.

Typically, you will want to set the Dialog node title field to prompt the user to enter a PIN, and add "OK" and "Cancel" buttons by setting the Dialog node buttons field to [ "OK", "Cancel" ], then observe the Dialog node buttonSelected field to react when the user presses one of those buttons. At any time, the PinDialog node pin field can be accessed to obtain the PIN value entered by the user.

The PinDialog node displays a privacy hint at the bottom of the dialog instructing the user how to show/hide the PinPad node focus indicator with the Options remote key. This provides more privacy for the user when entering a PIN. You should not override this default behavior of the Options remote key in the PinDialog node.
