Coordinates (x,y) for this interface are based on an origin (0,0) at the top, left. (This is common for 2D drawing APIs, but is different than OpenGL's default coordinate system).

Bitmap pixel values and color values are always represented as 32-bit integer RGBA color values.  That is, red is in the most significant byte and alpha is in the least significant byte.

## Supported methods

### Clear(rgba as Integer) as Void

#### Description

Clears the bitmap, and fills it with the specified RGBA color.

> The alpha channel will be filled into the bitmap, even when not used. Once AlphaEnable is set to true, the alpha channel will be taken into account when using this bitmap as a source. See SetAlphaEnable() for more information on alpha blending.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type    | Description                                   |
| ---- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| rgba | Integer | The RGBA color to be used to fill the bitmap. |

> Clear() is not the same as a DrawRect() for the entire bitmap. Clear() fills the bitmap with the specified RGBA; it does not perform any alpha blending operations.

### GetWidth() as Integer

#### Description

Gets the width of the bitmap.

#### Return Value

The width of the bitmap in pixels.

### GetHeight() as Integer

#### Description

Gets the height of the bitmap in pixels.

#### Return Value

The height of the bitmap in pixels.

### GetByteArray(x as Integer, y as Integer, width as Integer, height as Integer) as Object

#### Description

Gets the RGBA pixel values for the specified rectangle.

#### Parameters

| Name   | Type    | Description                        |
| ------ | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| x      | Integer | The x-coordinate of the rectangle. |
| y      | Integer | The y-coordinate of the rectangle. |
| width  | Integer | The width of the rectangle.        |
| height | Integer | The height of the rectangle.       |

#### Return Value

An roByteArray representing the RGBA pixel values for the specified rectangle.

### GetPng(x as Integer, y as Integer, width as Integer, height as Integer) as Object

#### Description

Gets PNG image data for the specified area of the bitmap. The PNG is in 32-bit RGBA format.

#### Parameters

| Name   | Type    | Description                        |
| ------ | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| x      | Integer | The x-coordinate of the rectangle. |
| y      | Integer | The y-coordinate of the rectangle. |
| width  | Integer | The width of the rectangle.        |
| height | Integer | The height of the rectangle.       |

#### Return Value

An roByteArray object containing PNG image data for the specified area of the bitmap. If the coordinates are out of bounds, or the PNG conversion fails for any reason, then invalid is returned

#### Example

```brightscript
function SaveTestPng()
    w = 200 : h = 100
    bm = CreateObject("roBitmap", {width: w, height: h, AlphaEnable: true})
    bm.DrawRect(10, 10, w-20, h-20, &hFF0000FF)
    bm.Finish()
    ba = bm.GetPng(0, 0, w, h)
    ba.WriteFile("tmp:/test.png")
 end function
```

### GetAlphaEnable() as Boolean

#### Description

Checks if the alpha blending is enabled.

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether alpha blending is enabled.

### SetAlphaEnable(enable as Boolean) as Void

#### Description

Enables alpha blending when the source bitmap is the destination. The setting of the source bitmap's alpha enable is ignored.

When alpha blending is enabled, each pixel in the destination bitmap is set by combining the destination and source pixels according to the alpha value in the source bitmap (or rectangle). The destination alpha is not used. (In OpenGL this is referred to as GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA).

By default, alpha blending is off. Even when alpha blending is off, the alpha value is still present in the bitmap, and it must be passed when a function parameter is a color, which is always RGBA.

#### Parameters

| Name   | Type    | Description                                          |
| ------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| enable | Boolean | A flag specifying whether alpha blending is enabled. |

#### Example

```brightscript
function Main()
    s=CreateObject("roScreen")
    ' Clear to White with alpha fully opaque
    ' but alpha not actually ever used since it is the bottom most plane
    ' alpha is only looked at on "source" planes, not "destination".
    s.Clear(&hFFFFFFFF)

    ' AlphaEnable must be enabled in the destination surface to have effect.
    s.SetAlphaEnable(true)
    bm=CreateObject("roBitmap", {width:100, height: 100, alphaenable: false} )
    bm.Clear(&h0000FFFF) 'blue, fully opaque alpha

    ' draw a blue rect in the upper left corner
    s.DrawObject(0,0, bm)
    s.Finish()
    Sleep(2000)
    s.Clear(&hFFFFFFFF)
    bm.Clear(&h0000FF00) 'blue, fully transparent alpha

    ' draw a blue rect in the upper left corner
    ' but, since it is transparent, nothing will appear on the screen.
    s.DrawObject(0, 0, bm)
    s.Finish()
    Sleep(2000)
 end function
```
