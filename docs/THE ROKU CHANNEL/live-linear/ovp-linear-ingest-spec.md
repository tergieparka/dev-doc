title: The Roku Channel live linear ingest specifications (OVP)

_Version 3.4_

## Overview

This specification describes the ingest specifications and EPG requirements required for your channel's content catalog to be included in [The Roku Channel](https://www.roku.com/whats-on/the-roku-channel). A catalog is the set of movies, series, TV specials, short-form videos or linear stream your channel provides, along with the artwork that represents it in the UI. A catalog feed (JSON) or Gracenote channel ID (aka ProgSrvID) includes the metadata that describes each asset so Roku can index it, categorize it, and present it to users. **Note: Gracenote channel id support is currently limited to linear channels with live sports only.**

The Roku Channel feed format follows the JSON-Schema Draft 4. All the properties in the schema are case sensitive. Before submitting a feed, make sure it is a valid JSON file. You can do that by using an IDE or free online tools, such as [JSON Schema Validator](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) or [JSON Schema Lint](https://jsonschemalint.com/#!/version/draft-07/markup/json).

For guidelines about presenting your channel's EPG, see [EPG on The Roku Channel](/trc-docs/live-linear/epg-on-trc.md).

### A note about deduplication of metadata

Roku augments metadata and artwork that appears in The Roku Channel on Roku devices, web browsers, mobile applications, and other off-platform players with data supplied from Gracenote’s database where available. The Gracenote data aids in a unified experience of a title across platforms as well as on the greater Roku ecosystem. Roku will attempt to match all content delivered by our Partners to a corresponding record in Gracenote’s database. _At this time all metadata and artwork that appears on The Roku Channel is sourced from Gracenote if that content is found in Gracenote’s database._

Our systems use a combination of methods to match a title its correct Gracenote record. Partners can aid in the matching to a Gracenote record by providing accurate metadata including:

- Exact title of a series, movie, TV special, or short form video

- Release dates that are accurate to the year the title was originally released on any platform

- Accurate season and episode numbers according to the original release order

- Accurate TMS (Gracenote) IDs or IMDB IDs by content type

  - Content classified as an episode with Gracenote must be delivered as an Episode to Roku

  - Content classified as a movie with Gracenote must be delivered as a movie to Roku

  - Content classified as a TV Special with Gracenote can be delivered as a movie to Roku

## Inclusion in The Roku Channel

In order for your content to be surfaced in The Roku Channel, you must adhere to this specification. If you already have a channel powered by Direct Publisher and you want its content to appear in The Roku Channel, you must ensure your feed meets the requirements described in this specification. Likewise, if you've built a channel using our developer program, then you must provide Roku with a separate feed adhering to this specification. The new feed must contain only assets that are available for display in The Roku Channel.

**Note that participation in The Roku Channel is currently limited to select partners. Configuring your feed to meet this specification is a prerequisite to be reviewed for inclusion. To submit a feed for approval into The Roku Channel, contact your Roku representative.**

All Linear Partners must utilize one of the **Linear Certified Partners** for their stream and EPG distribution: **Amagi, Wurl, Frequency, OTTera, Xumo, Akta, Zype, Evrideo, or Stenna**. Exceptions will only be considered if the partner can agree to abiding by all rules and requirements as outlined in the linear certification agreement which can be provided if such an exemption is necessary.

### Error Reporting

Stream and EPG issue reports go directly to the LCPs. Stream issues and high priority EPG issues are reported as needed. Comprehensive EPG issue reports go out weekly to all LCPs.

## Roku OVP

Roku now requires all live linear channels on TRC to run through their Online Video Platform (OVP). Below are the ingest specifications and input data template that needs to be filled out and provided to Roku Live Operations for all new live linear channels.

### Collection of Linear Channel Input Data

Roku Live Operations team provides templates to LCPs for channel acquisition details.

For Live events and Special integrations, a custom ingest document will be provided.

The following outlines what we support. A preferred video set up is outlined in the referenced column.

## Live Events

The following additional details are required for Roku discrete live events (DLEs) and insertion into Roku owned and operated linear channels.

- All live events must have both a primary and backup source
  - **SRT or Zixi Push preferred;** HLS and RTMP are not supported
- Live events intended for Roku O\&Os must include program start/stop SCTE messages
  - **Splice Insert messages are preferred**; Time Signal message type must include a splice command

### Metadata

- Ensure all event metadata is delivered to your Roku rep for the event as early as possible
  - **A Gracenote TMS ID for the event is preferred**
  - Metadata fields can be found here based on event type: [https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/trc-docs/live-linear/epg-on-trc.md#metadata-by-content-type](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/trc-docs/live-linear/epg-on-trc.md#metadata-by-content-type)

### Recurring events

- Roku has the ability to access third party APIs for recurring events. **Ask your Roku rep for details.**

# Direct Publisher Feed Schema

These are the properties for the root object of your EPG feed. It contains basic information such as your company's name, when the feed was last updated, and other objects that will describe all your content in detail. The URL for your feed should have the form "https\://_[yourfeeddomain.com](http://yourfeeddomain.com/)_".

The format of the feed is a comma-separated list with each property enclosed in double quotes. You must assign each asset (object) its own reference ID, which is a string. **Note**: The ID for an asset must not exceed 50 characters.

**_Note:_** Partners should not make programming updates to content scheduled to air within **48 hours** of live broadcast.

| **Field/Root Property** | **Content Type**                                      | **Required** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Kids-directed content

“**Kids-Directed Content**” means content that either: (i) is directed to children as defined by the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the content is shown (e.g., The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act); or (ii) was made for viewing primarily by children within the jurisdiction in which the content is shown.

You may NOT submit or distribute Kids-Directed Content unless you have Roku’s express written approval.

The following additional obligations apply to all Kids-Directed Content:

| **Field**       | **Type**                                             | **Required** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The following additional obligations apply to all live linear streams that include Kids-Directed Content:

- You will only include Kids-Directed Content in a live linear stream if that live linear stream is (and will always be) comprised exclusively of Kids-Directed Content. Do not mingle Kids-Directed Content and non-Kids-Directed Content in a live linear feed.
- You will provide a single TV content rating in the Rating Object reflecting the most restrictive rating of all Kids-Directed Content that will be available on the live linear feed.

### Additional kidsdirected guidelines

A `kidsdirected` tag should be inserted for any channel that is directed to children, based on a variety of factors, including the following:

- Ratings which designate the content as designed to be appropriate for children
