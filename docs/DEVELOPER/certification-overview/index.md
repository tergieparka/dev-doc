All public apps must meet Roku's [certification criteria](doc:certification) to be published to the Roku Streaming Store. This ensures that all apps in the Roku Streaming Store have properly integrated required platform features in order to provide viewers a consistent user experience.

## App testing

Roku provides a suite of tools and tests to help developers check whether their app complies with the [certification criteria](doc:certification):

- [Static Analysis tool](doc:static-analysis-tool): Checks the app's code for certification-related errors.
- [App Behavior Analysis tool](doc:channel-behavior-analysis-tool): Verifies that the app meets performance and deep linking requirements. This tool may be used for SVOD, AVOD, and free apps.
- [App pre-certification tests](doc:certification-testing): Provides a list of tests that apps can run during development to prepare for Roku's app certification process.

Developers are expected to use the [Static Analysis](doc:static-analysis-tool) and [App Behavior Analysis tool](doc:channel-behavior-analysis-tool) tools, the [list of pre-certification tests](doc:certification-testing), and the [certification criteria](doc:certification) to guide internal quality assurance testing before submitting an app to Roku for review and publishing.
