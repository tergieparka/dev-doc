# Roku Advertising Framework release notes

### Version 3.1 - 7/2022

- For apps that collect explicit in-app consent for ad targeting (for example, to adhere to GDPR), a new [**setLimitAdTracking()**](doc:raf-api#setlimitadtrackingenabled-as-boolean) function that specifies the value of the ROKU_ADS_LIMIT_TRACKING URL parameter macro to be passed into beacons and ad requests

- New Feature: Initial implementation of watermarking for ad requests and impression pixels to combat ad fraud
- Added Portuguese localization of the ad UI texts
- Multitude of bug fixes and enhancements, notably [stitchedAdsInit()](doc:raf-api#stitchedadsinitadpodarray-as-roarray) now clears the ad badge if called mid-ad break (*early cue-in* use case)
- Deployed to devices on Roku OS 9.4 and above

### Version 2.14 - 12/2020

- Added support for the characters **{|}"<>\^\`** (which are neither reserved nor unreserved by [RFC-3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)) by percent-encoding them in ad request and beacon URLs
- New [`enableInPodStitching(isIPS as Boolean)`](doc:raf-api#enableinpodstitchingisips-as-boolean) method brings benefits from [CSAS API](doc:csas) to apps using the classic CSAI [showAds()](doc:raf-api#showadsads-as-object-ctx-as-object-view-as-object-as-boolean) by stitching together multiple video clips within a single ad break (no buffering between ads)
- When parsing VAST, preserve the `id` attribute of `<MediaFile/>`
- Added support for [getAds()](doc:raf-api#getadsmsg-as-string-as-object) parsing a local file from tmp:/ via e.g. [setAdURL("tmp:/myVASTorVMAPorSMRX.xml")](doc:raf-api#setadurlurl-as-string)

- Deployed to devices on Roku OS 9.4 and above

### Version 2.13 - 7/2020

  - Fix errors on bad metadata (e.g. when parsing VAST, getting a single ad with  yet having fallback_index>0)

- Deployed to devices on Roku OS 9.2 and above

### Version 2.12 - 3/2020

- New Voting Ad
- Multitude of bug fixes and enhancements

### Version 2.11 - 11/2019

- New interactive ad features

- Deployed to devices with Roku OS 9.2 or above

### Version 2.10 - 08/2019

- Added handling of [voice ETC](doc:transport-controls) for ads
- Interactive ads improvements
- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Deployed to devices with Roku OS 9.1 and above

### Version 2.9 - 06/2019

- Added a [ROKU_ADS_LOCALE macro](doc:integrating-roku-advertising-framework#url-parameter-macros) which returns current locale in same format
  as [roDeviceInfo.getCurrentLocale()](doc:ifdeviceinfo#getcurrentlocale-as-string)
  (e.g. "en_US", "es_ES")
- Library manifests
  internally [rsg_version=1.2](doc:channel-manifest#special-purpose-attributes),
  which decreases memory use when RAF is included in complex apps. Note this is
  independent from the application-level *manifest* file, where you may separately
  declare *rsg_version=1.2* (or assume the default 1.1 [the default is now 1.2 as of Roku OS 9.3])
- New interactive ad features
- Improved diagnostics. Of note, when detected a URL with invalid characters,
  RAF would print
  a warning:

  ```brightscript
  [RAF.err] roUrlTransfer.setURL("some invalid URL") rejected argument - invalid chars? (space and "<>\^\`{|} must be %-encoded)
  ```
- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Deployed to devices with Roku OS 9.1 and above

### Version 2.8 - 04/2019

- New interactive ad units
- Added support for expanding multiple RAF macros per single URL query
  parameter value. Consequently, now composite query parameters like
  FreeWheel's `flag` are supported in generic manner
- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Deployed to devices with Roku OS 9.0 and above

### Version 2.7 - 01/2019

- Release with a primary focus on Roku OS 9.0 compatibility
- New interactive ad features
- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Deployed to devices with Roku OS 9.0 and above

### Version 2.6 - 10/2018

- RAF now shows test ads *only* in side-loaded ("dev") and unpublished apps.
- Added "In-Pod Stitching" capability for client-side ad-inserted (CSAI)
  apps, which provides an improved
  user experience that can eliminate buffering between multiple ads in an ad break.
  This can be enabled by developers for evaluation, and can by enabled in eligible
  production apps without the need for
  re-publishing.
- Improved RAF diagnostic messages
- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Deployed to devices with Roku OS 8.1 and above

### Version 2.5 - 05/2018

- Major rework of RAF's diagnostic output to [BrightScript console](doc:debugging#accessing-the-debug-console)
  - Warning messages (prefixed with "[RAF.err]") are always printed for known potential problems. Note that these are just additional diagnostics - they do not change the library's behavior, as compared to previous versions.
  - Substantially more information is printed when in setDebugOutput(true) mode: method call arguments and return values, [URL macros](doc:integrating-roku-advertising-framework#url-parameter-macros) expansion, ad XML/parsed, etc.
- New interactive templates by BrightLine/Innovid
- Deployed to devices with Roku OS 8.0 and above

### Version 2.4 - 03/2018

  built with different combinations of supported `ui_resolutions`

### Version 1.9 - 11/2016

- Freewheel SmartXML adReplica changes
  - Improve forecasting by only resolving ad requests for wrapped
    creative renditions that are placed into ad slots
  - Respect replicaId if specified in the adReference tag and a matching
    replica exists in the creativeRenditions, otherwise treat unwrapped
    renditions as alternate streams
- When Limit Ad Tracking is set by the user, use a new time-scoped ID that
  is cycled every 30 days to provide the benefits of frequency capping
  while still respecting the user's desire to avoid ad tracking

  whether content is targeted for kids
- Added a new content macro, ROKU_ADS_KIDS_CONTENT, and modified

### Version 1.8 - 10/2016

- Add missing tracking events for plain video ads in server-stitched
  streams: Impression, Pause, Resume
- Add contextual info for complete tracking event
- Add companion tracking metadata to Innovid ads, which do not
  explicitly have a CompanionAd tag to distinguish video ad tracking
  from microsite tracking
- Add 303 error tracking when wrapped VAST returns no ads
- New BrightLine templates
- Merged Innovid renderer changes, including modifications to tracking
  pixel logic
- New creativeAdId metadata field for ads
- Fix crash when replacing RAF macros in URL containing query
  parameter values without a name
- Correct pod-specific tracking for ad pods in server-stitched
  streams: PodComplete, PodStart
- Disallow re-rendering of ad pod when pod cache has been updated
  while rendering the pod (e.g., for TrueX ads)
- Re-purpose "Expand" and "Collapse" ad tracking to refer to microsite
  interactions for Innovid ads, which do not generally have a separate
  CompanionAd tag in the VAST representation for these additional
  tracking events
- Ignore replicaId values when specified in SmartXML ad slots, since
  these always refer to the first replica
- Treat multiple renditions of wrapped ads in SmartXML as replicas
- Override any creative ID set from a wrapped ad with the creativeId
  attribute in SmartXML, since this is likely more meaningful to the
  app than the wrapped ID
- Numerous TrueX/BrightLine bug fixes and feature changes
- Track ad render position values to prevent spurious
  Complete/PodComplete events when exiting microsites (playback of
  stitched video can resume across ad boundary, resulting in extra
  tracking pixels being fired)

### Version 1.7 - 06/2016

- New API: setContentMetaData(metaData): allows app to set information
  about the current content
- Added new HLS MIME type: "application/vnd.apple.mpegurl"

  instead of "true" or "false," to accommodate DFP's special LAT
  values
- Changed handling of invalid messages passed to the event handler for
  stitched ads to return either the cached ad data if an ad is
  currently being rendered, or Invalid if no ad is being rendered to
  accommodate apps that erroneously pass Invalid messages to the
  handler
- Prioritize MP4 over HLS ad creatives as HLS can take longer than the
  length of an ad to settle on an acceptable playback bitrate
- Add support for TrueX ad experience and parse new TrueX VAST
  extensions
- Invalidate rendering of current ad pod if pod cache has been updated
- Parse "special" wrapped URLs inside \<asset\> tag in SmartXML
- Numerous BrightLine changes to support rendering of choice cards,
  skip cards, managing ad pod cache when pods are skipped
- Modified backfill URLs slotname parameter to use ROKU_ADS_APP_ID
  as it was in v1.6
- Merged Innovid's latest code containing important tracking fixes
- Fix to the BrightLine code to address crashes on some devices still
  running 7.0 FW
- Fix bug that caused lower ad fill rates for SmartXML responses that
  included erroneous or empty ad tags in a given ad pod
