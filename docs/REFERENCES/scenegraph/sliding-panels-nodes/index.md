Sliding panels allow the creation of sets of other elements, such as
lists or grids, that are grouped into *panels* that can be moved left
and right on and off the display screen. The panels can also be created
(and removed) dynamically in response to user input and program
behavior.

## Sliding panel nodes

The following are the panel node classes supplied by Roku as part of the
SceneGraph API:

  - OverhangPanelSetScene
  - Overhang
  - PanelSet
  - Panel
  - ListPanel
  - GridPanel

## Panel nodes, panel sets, and panel set scenes

The **Panel**, **ListPanel**, and **GridPanel** node classes are the
panel node classes that can be extended to create a custom panel
component design in XML markup. The **Panel** node class is a generic
panel node that can include any type of content, while the **ListPanel**
and **GridPanel** node classes are specifically intended to contain list
or grid content respectively, with special features that can
automatically create new panels based on item selection in the panel
list or grid.

These panel node classes are designed to be used as part of a *panel
set*. Panel sets are groups of child panel nodes that can be dynamically
created and moved into view automatically after being created. The
**PanelSet** node class is the parent node class of the child panel
nodes in the panel set.

A special **Scene** node class is provided for panel sets:
**OverhangPanelSetScene**. The **OverhangPanelSetScene** node class by
default includes a child **Overhang** node, and a child **PanelSet**
node. The **Overhang** node class provides a region at the top of the
screen that is the full width of the screen, with default poster and
label elements that can be automatically targeted with content by the
focused panel in the **PanelSet** node. As part of an
**OverhangPanelSetScene** scene, the child **PanelSet** node is
automatically positioned below the **Overhang** node. The **PanelSet**
node class includes areas on the left and right side of the panel set
designed for automatic arrow indicators, to prompt the user to press the
<span>**Right**</span>,
<span>**Left**</span>, or
<span>**Back**</span> keys to select and
slide the
panels.

## Panel adding/sliding

As part of a panel set, panel node classes are designed to automatically
slide into and out of view in response to being added to the panel set
as a result of user input or other program behavior. To allow this
automatic adding/sliding behavior, panel node classes have a set of
default width sizes based on the width of the panel set, excluding the
arrow indicators on the sides of the panel set. The `panelSize` field
for panel node classes should be set to one of four width sizes:

<div class="table-wrap">

| Size   | Description                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| narrow | Approximately a third of the panel set width    |
| medium | Approximately one half the panel set width      |
| wide   | Approximately two-thirds of the panel set width |
| full   | Approximately the full panel set width          |

</div>

The precise horizontal positioning of panels in the panel set depends on
the screen resolution, as well as the setting of the `leftPosition`
field of the panel node. The `leftPosition` field determines the offset
from the left side of the panel set for a panel, but has default
settings based on screen resolution that generally should not be
changed. The actual pixel sizes and left position of the panels is as
follows:

<div class="table-wrap">

| Panel Field  | Panel Size | SD Value         | HD Value         |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| height       | all        | 403              | 605              |
| width        | narrow     | 218              | 388              |
|              | medium     | 292              | 520              |
|              | wide       | 363              | 645\<            |
|              | full       | 520              | 940              |
| leftPosition | narrow     | 60               | 105              |
|              | medium     | 60               | 105              |
|              | wide       | 63               | 112              |
|              | full       | 100              | 170              |

</div>

The width size you choose for each panel should be determined by the
size of the content of the panel, and the size of adjacent panels to the
left and right. When a panel is added that can only be displayed by
sliding an existing panel (or panels) to the left, the **PanelSet** node
class will automatically slide the existing panel or panels to the
left. So the simplest method to set up this automatic sliding of the
panels as needed is to select the default panel width sizes that fill
the panel set width at all times.

To do this, you should pair adjacent panels based on their width size.
For example, two medium panels that are added as the first two panels on
the left could be paired with full panel to be created on the right,
with the `isFullScreen` field set to true, which configures the panel to
be the only panel to be shown. Then when the full right panel is added,
the two medium panels slide automatically off the screen to the left,
and the full right panel slides into view from the right. Alternately,
you could pair a narrow and a wide panel on the left with a full panel
on the right. In some cases, you might want to create *tombstone* panels
with additional information on focused items in a panel to the left to
fill the panel set width.

After setting up the panels in the panel set according to size and
content, the panels will slide back and forth automatically based on
user <span>**Right**</span>,
<span>**Left**</span>, and
<span>**Back**</span> key presses,
adding new panels to the panel set, and putting the focus on
already-added panels. You add new panels as children of the panel set
using the `createChild()` function, or using the `createObject()`
function followed by the `appendChild()` function, depending on the
sequence your application will follow to slide the panels, because the
panels will not slide until added to the panel set.

## Sliding panels example

**Example Application:**
[SlidingPanels](https://github.com/rokudev/samples/tree/master/ux%20components/sliding%20panels)

The following adds two medium panels as children of a panel set in an
**OverhangPanelSetScene** component `init()` function, and sets up field
observers with callback functions to populate and add panels to the
right, and slide the panels back and forth based on user key
presses.

**Panel Adding/Sliding Example**

```brightscript
sub init()
  m.top.backgroundURI = "pkg:/images/rsgetbg.jpg"
  m.top.overhang.showClock = false
  m.top.overhang.showOptions = true

  m.categoriespanel = m.top.panelSet.createChild("categoriesListPanel")
  m.categoryinfopanel = m.top.panelset.createChild("categoryinfoPanel")
  m.categoriespanel.list.observeField("itemFocused", "showcategoryinfo")
  m.categoryinfopanel.observeField("focusedChild", "slideexamplesgridpanel")

  m.categoriespanel.setFocus(true)
end sub

sub showcategoryinfo()
  categorycontent = m.categoriespanel.list.content.getChild(m.categoriespanel.list.itemFocused)
  m.categoryinfopanel.description = categorycontent.description
  m.examplespanel = createObject("RoSGNode", "examplesGridPanel")
  m.examplespanel.overhangtext = categorycontent.shortdescriptionline1
  m.examplespanel.gridcontenturi = categorycontent.Url
end sub

sub slideexamplesgridpanel()
  if not m.top.panelSet.isGoingBack
    m.top.panelSet.appendChild(m.examplespanel)
    m.examplespanel.setFocus(true)
  else
    m.categoriespanel.setFocus(true)
  end if
end sub
```

The `categoriesListPanel` component object created as a child of the
panel set was defined as a medium panel in its component XML file, and
the same was done for the `categoryinfoPanel` component. For example,
the `categoriesListPanel` component was defined as
follows:

```xml
<component name="categoriesListPanel" extends="ListPanel">
  <script type="text/brightscript">
    <![CDATA[
      sub init()
        m.top.panelSize = "medium"
        m.top.focusable = true
        m.top.hasNextPanel = true
        m.top.leftOnly = true
        m.top.createNextPanelOnItemFocus = false
        m.top.selectButtonMovesPanelForward = true
        m.top.overhangTitle = "SceneGraph Examples"
        m.categorieslist = m.top.findNode("categorieslist")
        m.top.list = m.categorieslist
      end sub
    ]]>
  </script>

Since both the `categoriesListPanel` and `categoryinfoPanel` components
were defined as medium panels (each approximately one-half the panel set
width), they fill the entire panel set width. The `categoryinfoPanel`
component is defined as a simple tombstone panel to be targeted with
additional information on the focused item in the `categoriesListPanel`
component list on the left. It implements an `<interface>` element with
an `onChange` callback function attribute for a string
field:

**Simple Tombstone Panel XML Markup Example**

```xml
<component name="categoryinfoPanel" extends="Panel">
  <interface>
    <field id="description" type="string" onChange="showdescription" />
  </interface>

  <script type="text/brightscript">
    <![CDATA[
      sub init()
        m.top.panelSize = "medium"
        m.top.focusable = true
        m.top.hasNextPanel = true
        m.infolabel = m.top.findNode("infoLabel")
      end sub

      sub showdescription()
        m.infolabel.text = m.top.description
      end sub
    ]]>
  </script>

  <children>
    <Rectangle
      id="infoRectangle"
      translation="[0,40]"
      height="420"
      width="520"
      color="0x00000099">
      <Label
        id="infoLabel"
        translation="[15,15]"
        height="595"
        width="510"
        font="font:MediumBoldSystemFont" />
    </Rectangle>
  </children>
</component>
```

So when a user focuses on an item in the `m.categoriespanel` component
list, the `showcategoryinfo()` callback function triggered by the
`itemFocused` field change targets the `m.categoryinfopanel` panel
object with content for that item, and creates an `examplesGridPanel`
component object, a full width **GridPanel** node panel to the right.
Because the `m.examplespanel` panel object is created using
`createObject()`, but not yet added to the panel set, the panels do not
slide. The sliding is performed by the `focusedChild` field observer
callback function `slideexamplesgridpanel()` when focus moves to the
`m.categoryinfopanel` panel object in automatic response to user
<span>**Right**</span>,
<span>**Left**</span>, and
<span>**Back**</span> key presses. The
callback function moves the focus to either the left-hand
`m.categoriespanel` panel object, or the full width right-hand
`m.examplespanel` object, depending on the direction of the key press
indicated by the panel set `isGoingBack` field, automatically sliding
the panels in response to the focus change.

The full width `examplesGridPanel` component was defined as follows,
setting the `isFullScreen` field to true to automatically slide the
panel when added to the panel set and
focused:

```xml
<component name="examplesGridPanel" extends="GridPanel">
  <interface>
    <field id="overhangtext" type="string" />
    <field id="gridcontenturi" type="string" onChange="readpostergrid" />
  </interface>

  <script type="text/brightscript">
    <![CDATA[
      sub init()
        m.top.panelSize = "full"
        m.top.isFullScreen = true
        m.top.focusable = true
        m.top.hasNextPanel = false
        m.top.createNextPanelOnItemFocus = false
        m.top.optionsAvailable = true
        m.top.grid = m.top.findNode("examplesPosterGrid")
      end sub

      sub readpostergrid()
        m.readPosterGridTask = createObject("roSGNode", "postergridCR")
        m.readPosterGridTask.postergriduri = m.top.gridcontenturi
        m.readPosterGridTask.observeField("postergridcontent", "showpostergrid")
        m.readPosterGridTask.control = "RUN"
      end sub

      sub showpostergrid()
        m.top.grid.content = m.readPosterGridTask.postergridcontent
        m.top.overhangTitle = m.top.overhangtext
      end sub
    ]]>
  </script>
