The Roku socket-based BrightScript debug protocol enables Roku app development to be tightly integrated into Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). A tight integration helps expedite Roku app development as an IDE could be used to do the following:

* Write code using BrightScript syntax-directed editing and highlighting.
* Upload and run the app directly to the Roku media player.
* Communicate app stops and failures.
* Stop a running app.
* Inspect variables and stack traces of a stopped app.
* Step through a thread.
* Insert dynamic breakpoints.
* Resume a stopped app (if a fatal error has not occurred in the script).

> This protocol may be used in an interactive debugging session. Do not use it for storing data in a static file.

## Network Format

The network format of the protocol adheres to the following rules:

* Numeric values are sent in little-endian order.
* Data types are sent as a network byte stream in little-endian order.
* String values are encoded as UTF-8.

| Data Type     | Definition                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| binary32float | IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point value                |
| binary64float | IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point value                |
| bool          | 8-bit unsigned integer (0 = false; nonzero = true)  |
| int8          | 8-bit signed integer                                |
| uint8         | 8-bit unsigned integer                              |
| int32         | 32-bit signed integer                               |
| uint32        | 32-bit unsigned integer                             |
| int64         | 64-bit signed integer                               |
| uint64        | 64-bit unsigned integer                             |
| utf8z         | utf-8-encoded character stream terminated with '\0' |

> The notation used in this specification is similar to C++; however, the protocol describes the network data stream format—it does not define in-memory data structures.

## Debugging target startup sequence

After an app is launched with a request to enable remote debugging, the firmware waits for a connection from the remote debugger client. Immediately after a connection is established, an initial handshake is then performed. The handshake consists of the following data being sent by each end of the connection:

```c
struct HandshakeToDVP {    // DVP = Digital Video Player (Roku device)
    uint64 magic_number;   // 0x0067756265647362LU
};

struct HandshakeFromDVP {
    uint64 magic_number
    uint32 protocol_major_version;
    uint32 protocol_minor_version;
    uint32 protocol_patch_version;
    uint32 remaining_packet_length;
    int64  platform_revision_timestamp;
};
```

The behavior after the handshake has been executed, depends on the version of the BrightScript debug protocol being used:

* **2.0.0 (and later)**: The debug target will immediately stop on the first BrightScript statement in the script and send an ALL_THREADS_STOPPED message. The debugger client (for example, an IDE) may then set dynamic breakpoints in the target before its execution. In all cases, the debugger client must send a CONTINUE command to begin executing BrightScript code.
* **1.0.1**: The debug target runs immediately after the handshake.

## Debugger Request Format

Remote debugging clients can send a debugger request to the debugging target (for example, the script group) using the following packet structure for the network byte stream:

```c
struct DebuggerRequest {
    uint32 packet_length;
    uint32 request_id;
    uint32 command_code;
    uint8 command_arguments;
};
```

    uint32 error_flags;

## Debugger Update Format

The debugger sends an update message when a state change occurs in the application being debugged, which may or may not have been requested by the debugging client or user. DebuggerUpdate messages have a similar format as DebuggerResponse messages, except that the **request_id** is always **0**, and it includes an **update_type** field, which specifies the type of update being sent.

```c
struct DebuggerUpdate {
		uint32 packet_length;
		uint32 request_id;
		uint32 error_code;
		uint32 update_type;
		uint8 data;
};
```

### BreakpointVerified

_Available since [Roku OS 12.0](doc:release-notes#roku-os-120)_

A BREAKPOINT_VERIFIED message is sent when a breakpoint has successfully been applied to an executable line of code. Breakpoints may be added at any time; however, the changes may not be applied immediately if the debug target is running.  In this case, the **update_type** field in a DebuggerUpdate message is set to BREAKPOINT_VERIFIED, and the **data** field contains a structure named **BreakpointVerifiedUpdateData** that provides the ID assigned to the verified breakpoint. The **BreakpointVerifiedUpdateData** structure has the following syntax:

```c
struct BreakpointVerifiedUpdateData {
    uint32 flags // Reserved for future use
    uint32 num_breakpoints
    VerifiedBreakpointInfo[num_breakpoints]
}
```

```c
struct VerifiedBreakpointInfo {
    uint32 breakpoint_id

| source_code | utf8z  | The source code to be executed.                       |

### ExecuteResponseData

* **Success**: ErrorCode::OK. The code snippet was legal BrightScript and no compile-time errors occurred. However, the code itself may still generate a runtime error. For example, the code snippet "x = 5 / 0" will compile but generate a "divide by zero" runtime error. This error would be sent as text to the output stream of the debugging connection.

  If the error_code is `ErrorCode::OK`, the following fields are also included:

  | Field              | Type                      | Summary                                                             |

  | num_compile_errors | uint32                    | The number of compile-time errors.                                  |
  | compile_errors     | utf8z[num_compile_errors] | The list of compile-time errors.                                    |
  | num_runtime_errors | uint32                    | The number of runtime errors.                                       |

  | num_other_errors   | uint32                    | The number of other errors (for example, permission errors).        |
  | other_errors       | utf8z[num_other_errors]   | The list of other errors.                                           |

## Conditional Breakpoints

Conditional breakpoints enable developers to break inside a code block when a defined expression evaluates to true. Clients must use the ADD_CONDITIONAL_BREAKPOINTS debug command to add breakpoints that have conditional expressions (the ADD_BREAKPOINTS command must be used to add breakpoints without conditional expressions).

Use the LIST_BREAKPOINTS debugging command to get the existing conditional breakpoints and their status.

## Exception Breakpoints

_Available since Roku OS 14.1_

Exception breakpoints enable developers to pause the debugger whenever a runtime error is encountered or an exception is thrown. Unlike other breakpoints, exception breakpoints do not have an associated source file and line number, and they can not be listed or removed using LIST_BREAKPOINTS or REMOVE_BREAKPOINTS. Clients must use SET_EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINTS to set or clear the active exception breakpoints.

## Virtual Variables

_Available since Roku OS 14.1_

Virtual variables are values that can be retrieved with a VARIABLES request but do not correspond to actual variables (for example, the length of a container). By convention, variables start with a `$` character.

>  As of [Roku OS 15.2](doc:release-notes#roku-os-152), developers can use virtal variables to retrieve **roInputEvent**, **roUrlEvent**, and **roDateTime** values. This improves stepping performance when these virtual variables are expanded.

The following virtual variables are supported:

| Object Type     | Name                  | Type                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :-------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| roSGNode        | $children             | roArray                    | The SceneGraph children of the given node. This is equivalent to calling `node.getChildren(-1, 0)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| roSGNode        | $parent               | roSGNode                   | The SceneGraph parent of the given node. This is equivalent to calling `node.getParent()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| roSGNode        | $threadinfo           | roAssociativeArray         | The threadInfo of the given node. This is equivalent to calling `node.threadInfo()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Container types | $count                | Integer                    | The number of elements in the container. This is equivalent to calling `var.Count()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Virtual variables are only returned if both GET_VIRTUAL_KEYS and GET_CHILD_KEYS are set in the VARIABLES request.  Variable paths may include multiple virtual keys. For example, to get the first grandchild node's thread info, the client can send a request with the following path: `node.$children.0.$children.0.$threadinfo`.

## Sample remote debugger

You can [download the Roku Remote Debugger](https://github.com/rokudev/remote-debugger), which is a Python-based sample command-line remote debugger for testing and debugging Roku apps under development. The Roku Remote Debugger (**rokudebug.py**) provides the same functionality as the [BrightScript debug console](/docs/developer/debugging/index.md#brightscript-console-port-8085-commands); however, it demonstrates how the BrightScript network debug protocol could be used to integrate a debug tool into an IDE.

To run the Roku Remote Debugger, follow these steps:

1. Verify that you have Python 3.5.3 (or greater) installed on your machine.

2. [Create a ZIP file](/docs/developer/getting-started/hello-world.md#compressing-the-contents-of-the-hello-world-directory) containing the development app to be tested. You can also [download sample apps](https://github.com/rokudev/samples) to test with the debugger.

3. Sideload an app by entering the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

   `python rokudebug.py --targetip <Roku device IP address> --targetpass <Roku device webserver password> <development app zip file>`

   The following example demonstrates a command for running the debugger

   `python3 rokudebug.py --targetip 192.168.1.10 --targetpass abcd VideoListExample/Archive.zip`

4. Enter **help** to view a list of the available debug commands, which are as follows:

## [BETA] Visual Studio Code extension

You can [download](https://github.com/rokudev/debug-protocol-vscode-ext-beta) the beta version of the Visual Studio Code extension for the Roku BrightScript debug protocol. After extracting and installing the extension, you can use it for debugging Roku apps in Visual Studio.

## Demo video

The following video demonstrates the [Roku Remote Debugger](https://github.com/rokudev/remote-debugger), and it shows how the BrightScript network debug protocol could be used in an integration with an IDE such as Visual Studio Code.

## Change log

* **12-28-2024**: Roku Remote debugger 3.3.0 release.
  * **DebuggerRequest** messages now support a SET_EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINTS debugging command (code 12).
  * **DebuggerUpdate** messages include the EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT_ERROR (updat_type code 8) command.
  * The **Variables** debug command now supports requesting "virtual" variables using the GET_VIRTUAL_KEYS flag and VIRTUAL_PATH_INCLUDED keys.
* **03-06-2023**: Roku Remote debugger 3.2.0 release.
  * Support added for sending ADD_CONDITIONAL_BREAKPOINTS requests while the script is running.
  * **DebuggerUpdate** messages now include BREAKPOINT_VERIFIED (update_type code 6) and PROTOCOL_ERROR (update_type code 7) commands.
* **09-12-2022**: Roku Remote debugger 3.1.0 release.
  * **DebuggerRequest** messages now support an ADD_CONDITIONAL_BREAKPOINTS debugging command (code 11).  The LIST_BREAKPOINTS debugging command (code 7) now supports both conditional and non-conditional breakpoints.

  * **DebuggerResponse** messages now include **error_flags** and **error_data** fields if the value returned to the **error_code** field is not "OK" (error code 0).

  * **DebuggerUpdate** messages include the following new **update_type** codes:
    * BREAKPOINT_ERROR (update_type code 4). A compilation or runtime error occurred when evaluating the **cond_expr** of a conditional breakpoint
    * COMPILE_ERROR (update_type code 5). A compilation error occurred.

  * The **Variables** debug command now supports a new **path_force_case_insensitive** flag that forces a case-insensitive lookup of the corresponding path entry when enabled. Enabling this flag also requires the **VariablesRequestFlag** argument to be set to the new "CASE_SENSITIVITY_OPTIONS" value. This is useful for debugging scripts using "." notation for associative arrays, which is always case insensitive for all object types.
* **03-22-2022**: Roku Remote debugger 3.0.0 release.
  * The **HandshakeFromDVP** object, which is sent by a Roku device to a debugger client as part of the initial handshake, includes a new **platform_revision_timestamp** field that is primarily used to identify the Roku OS version of the device being used for debugging.

  * **DebuggerResponse** messages include a new **packet_length** field that enables a debugger client to read past non-essential data that it does not understand.

  * **DebuggerUpdate** messages include the following new THREAD_DETACHED (error code 6) and EXECUTION_TIMEOUT (error code 7) **error_code** status and codes:
* **08-14-2020**: Beta release of Visual Studio Code extension. Updated debug command table.
* **03-29-2020**: Roku Remote debugger 2.0.0 release. Added breakpoint and step commands.
* **11-09-2019**: Roku Remote debugger 1.0.1 release.
