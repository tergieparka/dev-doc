> Only standalone screensaver apps are permitted. Non-screensaver apps, including but not limited to video/audio streaming apps, games, and utilities, are prohibited from including screensavers.

## Overview

A screensaver is automatically invoked when either a video, game, utility, or application has been idle. The screensaver starts
according to  a user specified period of time.  The main operational difference between a screensaver and a streaming
app is that screensavers do not accept any user input (e.g., remote button push, etc). When a screensaver
is running, any user input terminates the screensaver and returns the user to the streaming app.

Screensavers **cannot** include:

* [DynamicComponent libraries](doc:componentlibrary)
* Ad insertion
* In-app purchases
* Deep links
* Any type of user-initiated, interactive functionality

## Screensaver context

When a screensaver is run, a new Brightscript context is created for screensaver execution. The
screensaver does not share Brightscript data objects with the streaming app.

The screensaver's [BrightScript Debugger](doc:debugging) uses port 8087.

## Discovery

All screensavers in the Roku environment use the **`RunScreenSaver()`** function. Note that **`RunUserInterface()`** or **`Main()`**
are prohibited for screensavers.

You can access the list of available screensavers in the screensaver store or menu that is discoverable on your device (in the Roku UI) by going to
**Settings > Theme > Screensavers**. This is where you can go to get, set, or remove screensavers. Note that once a screensaver is purchased and added
the screensaver is not displayed on the Roku Home screen.

## Settings

The **`RunScreenSaverSettings()`** function stores screensaver data in the device's registry. If a screensaver implements the **`RunScreenSaverSettings()`**
function a new context menu, called **Change screensaver settings** is available under the given screensaver detail menu.

After clicking **Change screensaver settings** the **`RunScreenSaverSettings()`** entry point is invoked allowing you to change developer specified screensaver options.

## Manifest entries

A screensaver must have an entry in its [manifest file](doc:channel-manifest) named
**`screensaver_title`** whose value is the title of the screensaver (usually the same as the title of the app).

> The **`screensaver_title`** manifest entry may only be used for screensaver applications. Other apps
> may not use this manifest entry; app publishing will be blocked if it is provided.

## Usable components

Normally a screensaver uses roScreen or roImageCanvas to display images
on the screen. Components which accept user input are not supported in a
screensaver. This is a list of components which **cannot** be used in a
screensaver.

* **`roAudioPlayer`**
* **`roChannelStore`**
* **`roVideoPlayer`**

## SceneGraph screensavers

You can also create screensavers in Roku SceneGraph. You should **not** create SceneGraph screensavers that require any type of user input
(such as a keyboard), or have video playback.
