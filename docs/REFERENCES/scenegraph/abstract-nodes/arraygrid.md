Extends [**Group**](doc:group)

The ArrayGrid node class is an abstract base class that provides functionality to the list and grid node classes that are extended from ArrayGrid. The field value settings and their effect in this abstract base class depend in many cases on whether a list, or a grid, node class is extended from ArrayGrid, and the specific type of list or grid.

The following node classes extended from ArrayGrid derive their basic functionality from the ArrayGrid abstract node class:

* [LabelList](doc:labellist)
* [MarkupList](doc:markuplist)
* [PosterGrid](doc:postergrid)
* [MarkupGrid](doc:markupgrid)
* [RowList](doc:rowlist)

> ArrayGrid is not meant to be instantiated directly by app code

### Data Bindings

Each node class extended from the ArrayGrid abstract node class will have custom data bindings.

## Fields

<th>Field</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Default</th>
<th>Access Permission</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>content</td>
<td>ContentNode</td>
<td>none</td>
<td>READ_WRITE</td>
<td>Specifies the content meta-data for the list or grid. This field must be set with a ContentNode that specifies the content meta-data for the list or grid in order for the list or grid to be displayed. See the Data Bindings section of each list or grid reference description for details on the content meta-data that must be specified in the ContentNode</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>numRows</td>
<td>integer</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>READ_WRITE</td>
<td>Specifies the number of visible rows displayed. Note that the actual number of rows may be more or less than the number specified depending on the number of items in the list or grid content</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>numColumns</td>
<td>integer</td>
<td>0</td>

The possible values are: <table><thead><tr><th>Option</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>floatingFocus</td><td>Causes the focus indicator to float left or right until it reaches the end of the row, at which point the focus indicator will stay fixed on the first or last item in the row, and the items will scroll left or right if there were items that were not visible.</td></tr><tr><td>fixedFocusWrap</td><td>Causes the row to wrap around when the focus indicator reaches the first or last item in the row, as long as the row contains enough items to fill the row.

<tr>
<td>drawFocusFeedbackOnTop</td>
<td>Boolean</td>

The focus feedback indicator will also after in and out when using the FFW/Rewind keys to scroll a page at a time.

<td>skipFocusAnimations</td>
<td>Boolean</td>
<td>false</td>
<td>READ_WRITE</td>
<td>Specifies whether changes in the focus item should be animated. If this field is set to true, any scrolling or repositioning/scaling of the focus indicator occurs without an animation. This causes fields reflecting the focus status (itemFocused, currFocusRow, currFocusColumn) to be updated instantly and not transition smoothly between old and new values.  For example, currFocusRow will go directly from 3.0 to 4.0 instead of taking on values between 3.0 and 4.0.</td>

This allows you to achieve a performance increase by specifying that individual sub-elements of the list or grid items occur on sequential rendering operations, rather than all of the item sub-elements being rendered in one rendering operation, which is the default. If you set this field to a value greater than 1, you must specify the rendering operation number for each of the item sub-elements as the renderPass field value for that sub-element. No sub-element that has a renderPass field value of 0 (the default), or has a renderPass field value greater than the value of the numRenderPasses field, will render</td>
