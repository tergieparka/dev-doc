| [roChannelStore](doc:rochannelstore) | allows the application to perform a purchase of an in-app product or upgrade an app |

## Supported methods

### GetIdentity() as Integer

#### Description

Returns a unique number for this object that can be used to identify whether a roChannelStoreEvent event originated from this object, by comparing with the roChannelStoreEvent object's GetSourceIdentity() value.

> The value can be any arbitrary value as assigned by the Roku OS, and should only be used for comparison purposes. For example, the value should not be used as an array index.
>
> For use as a look-up key, you can use GetIdentity().ToStr() as an associative array key.

#### Return Value

The unique number generated for the object.

### GetCatalog() as Void

#### Description

Requests the list of in-app products that are linked to the running app.

If successful, a subsequent [roChannelStoreEvent](doc:rochannelstoreevent) will be received that contains an roList of roAssociativeArray items. Each associative array will contain the following parameter names with specified value type:

### GetAllPurchases() as Void

#### Description

The **getAllPurchases** function is similar to the [**getPurchases** function](#getpurchases-as-void) except that it requests the historical list of all canceled, expired, and terminated subscriptions over the lifetime of the current user account—in addition to the active subscriptions. You can use this method to leverage purchase history in order to implement subscription renewal flows and more easily determine if subscriptions have expired.

If successful, a subsequent [roChannelStoreEvent](doc:rochannelstoreevent) will be received that contains an roList of roAssociativeArray items.

### SetOrder(order as Object, orderInfo as Object) as Void

#### Description

Sets the current Order (shopping cart) to the elements specified in the parameter, which must be an roList of roAssociativeArray items.<br /><br />Passing an empty roList clears the Order, like calling ClearOrder().

#### Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

### ClearOrder() as Void

| Name       | Return Type | Description                                                                   |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ClearOrder | Void        | Clears the current Order (shopping cart). After this call, the Order is empty |

### DeltaOrder(code as Object, qty as Integer) as Integer

#### Description

Applies a change in quantity to one item in the current Order (shopping cart).

* If the item identified by code is not in the **Order**, it is added with the specified **qty**.
* If the item already exists in the **Order**, **qty** is added to the quantity of this item in the **Order**.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type    | Description                                            |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| code | String  | The product identifier.                                |
| qty  | Integer | The quantity purchased. This may be a negative number. |

#### Return Type

The quantity of the item remaining in the Order after applying the change. If the returned value is zero or negative, the item is deleted from the Order.

### GetOrder() as Object

#### Description

Retrieves the current Order.

#### Return Value

The returned object is an roList of roAssociativeArray items, where each item contains the following parameter names with specified value type:

| Name | Type    | Description             |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| code | String  | The product identifier. |
| qty  | Integer | The quantity purchased. |

### DoOrder() as Boolean

#### Description

Displays the Streaming Store Product Purchase Screen populated with information from the current Order.

The user can then either approve and complete the purchase, or cancel the purchase. In the case that the user approves, the app should wait for and respond to the roChannelStoreEvent.isRequestSucceeded event to get the details of the completed transaction.

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the user approved the order (true if the order was approved; false otherwise).

### FakeServer(enable as Boolean) as Void

It is recommended that developers use [billing testing](doc:billing-testing) instead of this method.

#### Description

This test mode short circuits communication to the Streaming Store. It makes other methods get their responses to async queries and operations from configuration files, rather than actual server communication.

> Do not call this method in a production app.

#### Parameters

| Name   | Type    | Description                                                              |
| ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| enable | Boolean | If enable is true, enables a test mode for the roChannelStore component. |

To use this test method, create a **csFake** folder and add the following XML files to it in order to simulate web service request and response data:

* **csfake/GetCatalog.xml**: Simulates the list of products available for purchase in the app.
* **csfake/GetPurchases.xml**: Simulates the list of products already purchased by the user.
* **csfake/PlaceOrder.xml**: Contains information about the product to be ordered.
* **csfake/CheckOrder.xml**: Verifies the validity of the order placed. For example, if the **order** and **id** values in the PlaceOrder and CheckOrder XML files do not match, the fake server will report an error in the order processing.

See the [SimpleChannelStore sample app](https://github.com/rokudev/samples/tree/master/roku%20pay/SimpleChannelStore) for how to use this testing method.

### GetUserData() as Object

#### Description

The GetUserData() function provides a way to request user authorization to share the user’s account information with the calling app.

The primary use case of this method is to facilitate partner account creation/updating within apps that have a customer billing relationship with Roku.

For example, a developer may have a Roku app that offers a VOD subscription to users. This subscription may require an account with the content provider. The GetUserData() method could be called to read the user’s account information in order to prepopulate an account registration screen.

#### Return Value

When called, the method presents a dialog screen containing the user’s account information, along with two buttons labeled Share and Don’t Share.

* If the user presses the **Cancel** button, GetUserData() returns invalid.
* If the user presses the **Continue** button, GetUserData() returns an roAssociativeArray containing the following Roku account information for the app user (all values are Strings):
  * firstname

  * lastname

  * email

  * street

  * city

  * state

  * zip

  * country

  * phone

  * birth ("YYYY-MM")

  * gender ("Male", "Female", or unspecified)
  > For authenticated free and AVOD apps that are not enrolled in the [Roku Partner Payouts Program](doc:partner-payouts), a limited set of account information is returned:
  >
  > * **Sign-up RFI screen**: email, phone, and zip.
  > * **Sign-in RFI screen**: email and phone.

### GetPartialUserData(properties as String, requestInfo as Object) as Object

#### Description

This function works like GetUserData(), but allows the caller to specify which user data elements to return. The specified values are also displayed in the user data dialog screen.

#### Parameters

<table>

    <tr>
      <td>forceShowData</td>
      <td>Boolean</td>
      <td>If true, the RFI screen displays the values of the requested customer information to be shared with the app (for example, Jone Doe, <a href="mailto:bmsith@roku.com">j</a><a href="mailto:on.doe@emailaddress.com">[on.doe@emailaddress.com](mailto:on.doe@emailaddress.com)</a>). <br /><br />By default, this flag is set to false, which means that the default RFI screen for the region is used. For example, in the US, the RFI screen displays the type of customer information being requested (email address, name, and so on).<br /><br />This flag has no effect if the context field is set to "signin" (the RFI sign-in screen always displays the customer information values). <br /><br /><strong>Example</strong>:<br /><pre><code><code>\<br>\<br>store = CreateObject("roChannelStore")\<br>\<br>' Doesn't show user data in dialog unless necessary in he user's region.\<br>userData = store.GetPartialUserData("email,firstname,lastname,gender,birth")\<br>' Show user data values in dialog.\<br>userData = store.GetPartialUserData("email,firstname,lastname,gender,birth", }context: "signup", forceShowData: true})\<br>' forceShowData currently has no effect in signin context, as the shared data is always shown.\<br>userData = store.GetPartialUserData("email", }context: "signin", forceShowData: false})\<br></code></code></pre></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Return Value

### GetDeviceAttestation(nonce as String) as String

Generates a signed JSON web token (JWT) in the Roku cloud and returns it to the app. This token can then be used by the publisher's web services to verify that a message originated from a genuine Roku device. The following example demonstrates how to generate the device attestation token:

```brightscript
store  = CreateObject("roChannelStore")
nonce = GetRandomHexString(16)
token = store.GetDeviceAttestation(nonce)
```

#### Parameters

| Name  | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| :---- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| nonce | String | A random number used to generate the JWT token. This can be, for example, a hash of the user's account ID that can be verified by the publisher's services. |

#### Return Value

The generated JWT token. The following demonstrates a sample JWT that is returned to the app. Developers can use a [JWT debugger](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) to decode this token.

```

##### Verifying the JWT

To verify the JWT, developers must [download the Roku device attestation token certificate](https://devtools.web.roku.com/device_attestation_token_cert/RokuDeviceAttestationIntermediateCA.cert.pem) and authenticate that the token is signed by that certificate (see [https://jwt.io/introduction](https://jwt.io/introduction) for more information on JWT verification methods). The decoded JWT contains the following fields

##### Decoded JWT

The decoded JWT contains the following fields:

```brightscript
"x-roku-attestation-data":}
    "nonce": "5E0692E0A389F4F6",
    "channelId": "dev",
    "developerId": "caa73fbb5e75a46a4b6114de51a5ada7d616e2ed",
    "timestampMs": 1656377873990
 }
