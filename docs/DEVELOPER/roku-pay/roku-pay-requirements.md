        All subscription services that have streamed more than an average of 5 million hours per month over the last three months (and new subscription services projected to reach the specified streaming hour threshold shortly after launch) must implement Roku Event Dispatcher (RED) in the signup workflow.<br /><br />Apps must fire a RED event upon loading each page within the signup flow and submission of the final page to help track where users are abandoning the process. This includes, but is not limited to, the following pages: landing, sign up, registration, device activation, subscription selection, payment, purchase confirmation, and cancellation.<br /><br />If the app's sign-up flow is contained within a form that covers one or more pages, channels must fire a RED event when each element in the form is completed. Streaming hours per month information is available in the Developer Dashboard.
