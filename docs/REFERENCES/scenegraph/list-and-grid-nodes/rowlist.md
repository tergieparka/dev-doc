Extends [**ArrayGrid**](doc:arraygrid)

The RowList node class provides a vertically-scrollable list, containing rows of independent horizontally-scrollable individual items. Each item in a row can include a poster, but can also include much more complex sub-elements defined in an item component file, in the same way that items are defined in the [MarkupList](doc:markuplist) and [MarkupGrid](doc:markupgrid) node classes. The RowList node class includes interface fields for customizing the appearance as the user scrolls up and down through the rows.

Like those node classes, the RowList node class provides special interface fields to the item components to allow custom appearance and animations as the user scrolls left and right through the items in a row.

>You can use the [ZoomRowList](doc:zoomrowlist) node class to enlarge the row in the RowList that currently has focus. In addition to providing a zoomed focus row, the ZoomRowList features custom row item and row decoration components, unique zooming amounts for individual rows, and separate heights for zoomed/unzoomed row items.

## Guidelines

The following are guidelines for use of rows and images.

- The items in any single row must be the same size, however different rows in the list can have different item sizes (see sample image below).
- Each row may include a left-justified title label at the top of the row, and a right-justified label at the top that displays a message of the format "*item\_number* of *total\_number\_of\_items*", indicating which item in the row currently has focus.

#### Horizontal Row Scrolling

There are three horizontal item scrolling options for the RowList node class controlled by the `rowFocusAnimationStyle` field.

- Setting the `rowFocusAnimationStyle` field to `floatingFocus` causes the focus indicator to float left or right until it reaches the end of the row, at which point the focus will stay fixed on the first or last item in the row, and the items will scroll left or right.
- Setting the `rowFocusAnimationStyle` field to `fixedFocusWrap` causes each row to wrap around when navigation reaches the first or last item in the row, as long as the row contains enough items to fill the row. If the row does not contain enough items to fill the row, the focus will float left and right.
- Setting the `rowFocusAnimationStyle` field to `fixedFocus` causes the focus to stay fixed on the first item in each row. As the user scrolls, the previous selected item goes off the screen. Scrolling continues until the last item is reached with no wrapping.

#### Vertical Row Scrolling

The vertical row scrolling options are controlled by the `vertFocusAnimationStyle` field, and behave in the same way for rows as they do for list items as described in [**ArrayGrid**](doc:arraygrid).

The RowList node class supports two types of item definitions.

- The first type provides a simple option for the common case where each item in each row is displayed as a single poster.
- The second variation allows the contents of each item in each row to be an instance of a SceneGraph component that defines a set of interface fields that provide for communication between the RowList node and the items it displays (similar to that used by the MarkupList and MarkupGrid node classes).

## Example

The following is a sample screenshot of RowList based on SimpleRowlist sample code:

![roku815px - rowlist1](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/rowlist1.png "rowlist1")

In the field descriptions below, the first type is referred to as *simple*, and the second type is referred to as *component*. Most of the field descriptions below apply to both simple and component types.

## Behavior

Whenever all the items in a RowList row are visible, the focus will step one-by-one across the items, rather than step once, then smooth scroll.

Each time the RowList focus animation completes a step, the RowList's rowItemFocused field will be set. This allows the Bob to be immediately updated. This will happen when long press scrolling after the initial step ends prior to the smooth scrolling. It will also happen when long press scrolling across a short RowList row as the focus now steps one-by-one across the items in a short row. Previously, the rowItemFocused field was only set once after a long press scrolling key release event.

## RowList XML component

If the RowList node is to use an XML component, the `itemComponentName` field value should be set to the name of an XML component used to display each item in the row list. An instance of this component is created for each visible item in each row of the list.

If the XML component contains interface fields that match the names shown in the table below, those fields will be updated by the RowList node. This allows the XML component to alter the item appearance based on changes to these interface fields.

Note that the fields are updated in the order presented in the table below. Any layout scripting you write based on these fields should be done in that order to avoid updating your layout based on a field that has not been updated yet.

## Data bindings

A RowList node should have a single ContentNode as the root node in its content field. One child ContentNode should be added to the root node for each row in the list (these nodes can be thought of as row nodes). Each row node should contain one child ContentNode for each item in the row (these nodes can be thought of as item nodes).

### Row node data bindings

| [AdvancedRowList](https://github.com/rokudev/samples/tree/master/ux%20components/lists%20and%20grids)          | Example demonstrating use of RowList in a PanelSet. This example includes RowList loading real data from a JSON file, mixed aspect ratio posters, and the use of focusPercent to overlay annotations.      |
| [variableWidthRowList](https://github.com/rokudev/samples/tree/master/ux%20components/lists%20and%20grids)     | A simple example demonstrating variable width items. The first row in the RowList contains large hero artwork and each subsequent row contains a mix of different aspect ratio posters for TV and Movie artwork.      |
