## Avails and Committed Title Lists for The Roku Channel

Roku requests an initial launch list of titles/episodes/shortForm videos in the current library that are available to Roku at the time of onboarding and a schedule when the content will be refreshed. For ongoing production, Roku requests that a Committed Title List be provided **60** days prior to licensing window start and the content be delivered in accordance with [The Roku Channel Ingest Specification](https://go.roku.com/ingest-ovp-specs) at least 30 days before licensing window start to allow ample time for selection, ingest, processing, and QC of the content before it goes live on The Roku Channel. 

### Roku content policies

#### Ad-supported content on The Roku Channel

The Roku Channel is looking for ad-supported content that is appropriate for our users and advertisers – for example, The Roku Channel does not want ad-supported content that contains excessive nudity or extreme/graphic violence.  Please use your best judgement when sharing content. If an asset is questionable, please find an alternative to share. We reserve the right to remove or reject any content that we deem inappropriate.

#### Kids directed content policy

“Kids-Directed Content” is content that either: (i) is directed to children as defined by the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the content is shown (e.g., The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act); or (ii) was made for viewing primarily by children within the jurisdiction in which the content is shown.

- You may NOT submit or distribute Kids-Directed content without Roku’s express written approval.
- Roku must be made aware of the intent to submit or distribute Kids-Directed content via submission of the avails and Committed Title List document populating the columns outlined below:
  - Kids-Directed column must be populated with the value "true"
  - The Rating Source column must be populated with a valid Rating Source
  - The Rating Value column must be populated with a valid parental [Rating](#ratings) from that Rating Source
  - “UNRATED” and “Not Rated” are not acceptable ratings for kids directed content

##### Optional age demographics tags

Additional tags can be provided to help categorize kids-directed content around age demographics. Please use these tags to define different content directed age groups:

| Ages     | Tags        |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Ages 1-3 | ages_1-3    |
| Ages 4-6 | ages_4-6    |
| Ages 7-9 | ages_7-9    |
| Ages 10+ | ages_10plus |

### Avails

“Avails” is short for availability. It refers to the list of available content for licensing or distribution. The avails list is shared with Roku to aid in understanding what content is currently available for acquisition or distribution. Avails typically include information about the titles, such as the title name, genre, duration, rights availability (e.g., exclusive or non-exclusive rights), and any other relevant details about the content. Avails should be sent to the Content Partnerships team ([trcpartnersupport@roku.com](mailto:trcpartnersupport@roku.com)) for Selections review. Once the Content Partnerships team has reviewed the Avails, they will provide the Avails sheet back with Selections marked for review and any revisions. The agreed-upon list of Selected content becomes the Committed Title List

### Committed Title List:

A “Committed title list” (CTL) is a comprehensive list of all the titles that have been committed and made available to Roku as agreed upon through the Selections process. Similar to avails, a CTL includes information about each title, such as the title name, genre, duration, and any other relevant details. CTLs are used for content management purposes and provide an overview of the committed content catalog from the content Partner. CTLs should be finalized for ingestion into Roku's Rights Management system at least 60 days prior to the start date of the titles in the list. The data provided in the CTL will control the availability of titles on The Roku Channel.

*The descriptive metadata (Title, Synopsis, Genre, etc.) provided in the avails and/or title list will be used for selection purposes only. Descriptive metadata must be included at the time the content is delivered in accordance with [The Roku Channel ingest specifications](https://go.roku.com/ingest-ovp-specs).*

### Availability windows

An availability window is the length of time during which a title is viewable by a user on The Roku Channel. Availability windows can include several different attributes in a number of combinations. Each unique combination of attributes bound by a start and end time is considered its own availability window. Each availability window should be represented in the avails or Committed Title List on its own row. The availability attributes currently supported by Roku are:

- License Type
- Territory
- Language

#### Availability date and time

Roku has the ability for content to display on-device and for user playback at a specific starting time. By default, content will go into window at 12:00 am (midnight) and expire at 11:59:59 pm in the users’ time zone.

If content is to go live at a time other than midnight or expire at a time other than 11:59:59 pm, the license window start or end values in the inbound metadata must include the desired times.

There are two types of specific time designations – relative and absolute.

- Relative Time – a Saturday night premiere of a movie goes into window at 9pm local time for all users. A user in the Eastern Time Zone watches at 9pm but a user in the Pacific Time Zone, at the exact same moment (6pm PT), cannot watch that content.
- Absolute Time – a new episode of a series goes into window at 9pm Eastern and becomes immediately available across all time zones. A user in the Pacific Time Zone can watch the content at 6 pm local time.

 While time settings are dictated by the content owner, Roku will need the metadata as follows:

- If the content has a relative start time, that time must be indicated in the ingest metadata and formatted as “yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss” (2019-11-01T21:00:00)
- If the content has an absolute start time, that time must be indicated in the ingest metadata. The time must be presented as UTC time and formatted as “yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ” (2019-11-02T01:00:00Z).
- In this example, 9 pm Eastern Time on November 1 is 1 am UTC (https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com)
- If the metadata arrives without a time, Roku will assume a relative start time of 12:00:00 am and a relative end time of 11:59:59 pm

### Submitting Excel Avails/Committed Title Lists

Avails must be submitted via email to [trcpartnersupport@roku.com](mailto:trcpartnersupport@roku.com) for selection review. Committed Title Lists must be finalized at least 60 days prior to the intended licensing window start date of the titles within the list. In certain cases we may be able to accept avails and Committed Title Lists via Aspera. Please reach out to your Roku representative for current delivery options.

When submitting avails and Committed Title Lists via Excel workbook, all required fields must be populated. Roku has provided hints on row 2 of the Roku avails and Committed Title List template to highlight the required cells and any special formatting needed for each cell. Please refer to these hints when filling out the Roku avails and Committed Title List template. Other considerations when filling out the Roku Avails and Committed Title List Excel sheet include:

- All data MUST begin on row 3. DO NOT DELETE THE HINTS ON ROW 2
- Any formulas used must be converted to text prior to submission. Inclusion of a formula will result a rejection of the avails and Committed Title List sheet
- Do not link to external data or Excel workbooks. All data must be self contained within the Excel workbook delivered to Roku
- Do not add additional sheets to the workbook
- Do not add additional columns to the workbook
- Do not change any of the column header names
- Do not supply a value of “N/A” or “n/a”. Required cells should contain valid data and optional cells may be left blank
- Each row is considered a unique availability window for an episode/movie/shortForm video
- Do not leave a blank row between entries in a worksheet. The system will terminate processing at the first empty row
- Avails and Committed Title List sheets must be saved with .xlsx extension

### Ratings

A valid film or TV rating from the rating authority (Rating Source) of the Territory the title will be available in shall be provided for each movie, episode, or shortForm video. If the title has not been rated by that Territory’s official rating authority, a rating of NR (Not Rated) may be provided, however please note that Roku strongly prefers an actual rating on all content. Titles with a rating of NR (Not Rated) will be subject to manual verification which can delay the selection process and publishing to The Roku Channel. Discoverability on The Roku Channel may also be impacted for titles with the NR (Not Rated) rating and placement within the Kids & Family experience will be prohibited. In lieu of the NR (Not Rated) rating, the title should be self rated using the USA_PR rating system. Guidelines pertaining to the USA_PR ratings can be found [here](http://tvguidelines.org/)
