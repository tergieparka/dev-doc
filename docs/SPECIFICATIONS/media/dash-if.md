The support for DASH-IF in Roku OS is based on ["Guidelines for Implementation: DASH-IF Interoperability Points" (Version 4.3: November, 2018](https://dashif.org/docs/DASH-IF-IOP-v4.3.pdf) – we refer to this publication as "DASH Interop Guidelines," and the specific interoperability points as IOPs). While extensive, Roku's support for this comprehensive specification is not yet complete. This article covers known discrepancies between the full DASH standard and Roku's support for it in the runtime content player and other facilities. Discrepancies will be added to this list as they are discovered; developers should alert Roku to any discrepancies not mentioned here, so that proper attention can be paid to them, toward the goal of improving Roku's support for the DASH standard.

## Updates

### UTCTiming

As of [Roku OS 10.0](doc:release-notes#roku-os-100), the Roku OS supports the use of **UTCTiming** elements in DASH MPDs (manifests), as described in Section 4.7.2 of ["Guidelines for Implementation: DASH-IF Interoperability Points" (Version 4.3: November, 2018](https://dashif.org/docs/DASH-IF-IOP-v4.3.pdf). A **UTCTiming** element declares a mechanism that the player can use to keep its clock in synchronization with that of the streaming server. Here is an example:

```xml
<UTCTiming schemeIDUri=" urn:mpeg:dash:utc:ntp:2014" value="time.nist.gov"/>
```

The `schemeIDUri` parameter indicates the mechanism selected (one of several available options given in Section 4.7.2), while the `value` parameter indicates the standard time source to be employed.

### Initialization segment format for multi-period server-stitched manifests

As of [Roku OS 10.5](doc:release-notes#roku-os-105), the Roku OS supports the use of the initialization segment format for server-stitched DASH manifests formatted with multi-periods.

### SegmentTimeline

As of [Roku OS 10.5](doc:release-notes#roku-os-105), the Roku OS supports the use of the SegmentTimeline to precisely identify segment availability. This supports the in-progress playback of content while it is being recorded.

Specifically, the Roku OS DASH implementation now supports:

* Initialization element with sourceURL attribute in under SegmentBase element.
* RepresentationIndex element.
* Index segments in a different file than the media segments.
* Index segments from multiple representations in the same file.
* Media segments from multiple representations in the same file.
* Non-standard AudioChannelConfiguration schema: `urn:dolby:dash:audio_channel_configuration:2011`.
