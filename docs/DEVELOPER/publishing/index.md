Before submitting an app for publication in a new Streaming Store it previously had not been distributed in, publishers should take the time to make sure their app is compliant with local laws and will provide the best end-user experience for the audience in the new region where the app will be distributed.

Publishers can review this basic pre-publishing checklist provided to help ensure legal, monetary, and marketing concerns are addressed at launch time. However, this checklist is only intended to serve as a reminder of potential consideration related to the app launch and should not replace your own due diligence related to launching an app in a new market.  Ultimately, as provided in the [Roku Distribution Agreement](https://docs.roku.com/published/developerdistribution/en/us), you are responsible for ensuring your app complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

#### Content rights

* Confirm rights to distribute app content to viewers in the relevant country or countries (the "territory").
* Ensure that the distribution agreement in place with Roku covers the territory. In most cases, this entails reviewing the current terms of the [Roku Distribution Agreement](https://docs.roku.com/published/developerdistribution/en/us).

#### Regional compliance

* [Localize](doc:localization) the language of all relevant textual or graphic elements to the predominating language in the territory.
* Implement any required content geo-restrictions.
* Review and comply with [local legal regulations](doc:legal), such as any relevant laws pertaining to data privacy or restricting targeted advertisements to children. Note, this is not intended to be a comprehensive list of applicable laws and regulations applicable in each new territory.
* Apply [local content ratings](doc:content-metadata) to the content metadata.
* Ensure any [video advertisements](doc:integrating-roku-advertising-framework) running within the app are relevant to the audience.
* Ensure any [subscription pricing models](doc:product-catalog) have been adjusted for the territory.

#### Discovery and support

* [Enable the app for inclusion in Roku Search](doc:search-feed) in the region, if applicable. This may include providing a dedicated feed for content available in the region or localizing the metadata to the relevant language.
* Establish local customer support apps and ensure this information is easily accessible to the end-user.
* If applicable, coordinate local PR and marketing efforts with Roku to drive awareness of the app launch in the territory.
