Extends [StandardDialog](doc:standard-dialog)

The **StandardPinPadDialog** node enables text and voice entry of numeric characters—typically, short numeric PIN codes. It is similar to the legacy [PinDialog](doc:pindialog) node, but includes additional voice entry of the numeric digits. This additional functionality is provided through the node's internal DynamicPinPad and VoiceTextEditBox nodes.
