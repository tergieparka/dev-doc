You can supply localized versions of the
strings and package graphical images used in a SceneGraph application
package. The SceneGraph application can then automatically insert the
localized versions of the strings and graphical images that you supply,
according to the current locale as set by the user.

You can also localize your application from your server using URL directives based on the current locale as set by
the user.

> The application package localization features rely on the locales and locale
IDs currently supported by Roku. The list of these supported locales can be found in the description of the [ifDeviceInfo](doc:ifdeviceinfo) `GetCurrentLocale()` method.


## Localizing strings in the application package

For each string to be localized, provide localized translations of the string, in as many languages as you want
that are currently supported by Roku. You can provide localized strings
in either the TS or XLIFF XML localization file formats as supported by
Roku. The string localization files should be placed in the
`pkg:/locale/` subdirectory for the supported locale. For example, if
you want to include a `translations.ts` localization file in the TS
format for Canadian French, place the file in the `pkg:/locale/`
subdirectory named for the locale ID `fr_CA`:

```
pkg:/locale/fr_CA/translations.ts
```

For strings defined in XML markup in a
\<children\> element, or \<interface\> element field strings,
the strings will be automatically translated by the SceneGraph
application, if translations of the string exist in the localization
files. If no translation file exists for the current locale, or no
translation of the string exists in the translation file, the original
string will be used.

> All field values set in markup will be translated if the string value has a
> corresponding entry in a translation file.
> Roku best practices therefore strongly recommend initializing RSG field values
> that need to be localized in the corresponding BrightScript Init() function.

For strings assigned using BrightScript in a
\<script\> element, you can use the
[`tr()`](doc:global-utility-functions)
function to localize a string, if you have provided a translation of the
string in a `translations.xml` file in the XLIFF XML format in the
package directory `pkg:/locale/locale_ID/` directory. The `tr()`
function is a global BrightScript utility function that looks for the
string in the `translations.xml` file, then finds the
corresponding string translation in the file for the current locale. To
use the `tr()` function to localize a specific *source* string:

```brightscript
tr(String source) as String
```

For example, to translate the string "hello world" in BrightScript:

```brightscript
m.greetinglabel.text = tr("hello world")
```

The `tr()` function will look for the
`pkg:/locale/locale_ID/translations.xml` file, and look in the file for
the "hello world" source string. If the source string exists in the
file, with a translated string, the translated string will be returned,
and assigned to the `text` field of the
[**Label**](doc:label) node object `m.greetinglabel`. If no
translation file exists, or the source string and translated string does
not exist in the file, the original source string will be returned, and
assigned to the `text` field.

The `tr()` function also supports string substitutions. For example:

```brightscript
text = tr("Video will start in %1 seconds").Replace("%1", numSeconds.ToStr())
```

## Localizing graphical images in the application package

For each graphical image to be localized,
provide each localized image in the `pkg:/locale/` directory, in
as many languages as you want that are currently supported by Roku. Then
use the following format for the value of the `uri` field of the
[Poster](doc:poster) node:

```
pkg:/locale/images/localized_image
```

For example, to provide a localized version of `myPoster.jpg`, set the
Poster node `uri` field as follows:

```xml
<Poster uri="pkg:/locale/images/myPoster.jpg" />
```

This causes the application to search through the `pkg:/locale`
directory in the following order to find the localized graphical image.
The first graphical image of the specified name found in this search
sequence is returned to be rendered by the SceneGraph application.

1.  not localized
    `pkg:/locale/images/image_name `
2.  current locale
    `pkg:/locale/locale_id/images/image_name `
3.  default
    `pkg:/locale/default/images/image_name `
4.  US English
    `pkg:/locale/en_US/images/image_name `

If none of those files exist, the URL access will fail to return a file.

For example, if you want to have a localized version of a graphical
image for Canadian French, and a default image for all other languages,
place two versions of the image in the `pkg:/locale` directory as
follows:


`pkg:/locale/fr_CA/images/image_name_canadian_french`
`pkg:/locale/default/images/image_name_default`


In Brightscript in a \<script\> element, you can also use the getLocalizedAsset() method in [ifLocalization](doc:iflocalization) to get a localized
graphical image.

For example:

```brightscript
localize = createObject("RoLocalization")
bannerposter = m.top.findNode("bannerPoster")
bannerposter.uri = localize.GetLocalizedAsset("images", "banner.png")
```

Is equivalent to:

```brightscript
bannerposter = m.top.findNode("bannerPoster")
bannerposter.uri = "pkg:/locale/images/banner.png"
```

## TS file example

The following is an example of a
`translations.ts` file in the TS XML format placed in the
`pkg:/locale/fr_CA` directory to translate English to Canadian
French:

**Example of a translations.ts file in the TS XML format**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE TS>
<TS version="2.0" language="fr_CA" sourcelanguage="en_US">
  <defaultcodec>UTF-8</defaultcodec>
  <context>
    <name>default</name>
    <message>
      <source>Hello</source>
      <translation>Bonjour</translation>
    </message>
    <message>
      <source>Goodbye</source>
      <translation>Au revoir</translation>
    </message>
    <message>
      <source>Christmas</source>
      <translation>Noel</translation>
    </message>
  </context>
</TS>
```


## XLIFF file example

The following is an example of a
`translations.xml` file in the XLIFF XML format placed in the
`pkg:/locale/fr_CA` directory to translate English to Canadian
French:

**Example of a translations.xml file in the XLIFF XML format**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xliff version="1.2" xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:1.2">
  <file source-language="en-US" target-language="fr-CA" >
    <body>
      <trans-unit id="0">
        <source>Hello</source>
        <target>Bonjour</target>
      </trans-unit>
      <trans-unit id="1">
        <source>Goodbye</source>
        <target>Au revoir</target>
      </trans-unit>
    </body>
  </file>
</xliff>
```

## Localizing content

Apps can identify the region associated with a customer's Roku account to determine which content to display in the app UI. For example, apps can [get the external IP address of a Roku device](doc:ifdeviceinfo) client-side, and return it back to the app's backend server. In the backend, the app can get the country ranges mapped to the IP address in order to determine which content to show to the customer and allow streaming. See [App localization](doc:channel-localization) for how publishers should consider localization in the development, distribution, engagement, and monetization of their apps
