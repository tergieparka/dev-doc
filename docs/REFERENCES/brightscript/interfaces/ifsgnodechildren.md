The ifSGNodeChildren interface allows querying and manipulation of nodes in a SceneGraph node tree, such as creating new nodes, placing them at certain positions in the tree, and removing them.

## Implemented by

| Name                     | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [roSGNode](doc:rosgnode) | The roSGNode object is the BrightScript equivalent of SceneGraph XML file node creation |

To use the methods in this interface to manipulate child nodes at the scene level, the subject nodes must be wrapped in another element, typically a Group node. For example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<component name="myScene" extends="Scene">
  <script type="text/brightscript">
    <![CDATA[
      sub init()
        m.myGroup = m.top.FindNode("myGroup")
        m.label = m.myGroup.getChild(0)
      end sub
    ]]>
  </script>

  <children>
    <Group id="myGroup">
      <Label id="myLabel" ... />
    </Group>
  </children>
</component>
```

In the example above, m.label will contain the roSGNode corresponding to the Label node after the getChild() call. On the other hand, the following will not work:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<component name="myScene" extends="Scene">
  <script type="text/brightscript">
    <![CDATA[
      sub init()
        m.label = m.top.getChild(0)
      end sub
    ]]>
  </script>

  <children>
    <Label id="myLabel" ... />
  </children>
</component>
```

The Scene node children are hidden elements used by the SceneGraph framework. Thus, despite the fact that the Label node is in the scene \<children> element, it will not be retrieved by getChild() .

> Removing or replacing a node in a SceneGraph node tree can cause that node to be destroyed entirely if there are no more references to it.

cn.addfield("b","string",false)
cn.addfield("c","string",false)
cn.update(aa,false)
'At this point, cn would contain the following:

<Component: roSGNode> =

The [appendChildren()](#appendchildchild-as-rosgnode-as-boolean) function can be used to add the extra items.

#### Parameters

| Name        | Type    | Description                                                              |

## Debugging-only Methods

The following methods can be called on any subject node and return the same global results. They can be used in a development app for debugging purposes, but should not be used in a production app.

<p>>These methods are similar to the debugger sgnodes commands. See <a href="/dev/docs/debugging#scenegraph-debug-server-port-8080-commands">Special SceneGraph Debugging Commands</a> for information on the debugger sgnodes commands. Also please note that calling these functions from code should only be done for debugging purposes. Any calls to <a href="#getall-as-object">getAll()</a>, <a href="#getroots-as-object">getRoots()</a>, <a href="#getrootsmeta-as-object">getRootsMeta()</a> and <a href="#getallmeta-as-object">getAllMeta()</a> should be removed from your production channels. |</p>

### getAll() as Object

#### Description

Returns an array with every existing node created by the currently running app.

#### Return Value

An roArray with the all the existing nodes created by the app.

### getRoots() as Object

#### Description

Returns an array with every existing node without a parent created by the currently running app.

The existence of these unparented nodes means they are being kept alive by direct BrightScript references. These could be in variables local to a function, arrays, or associative arrays, including a component global m or an associative array field of a node.

#### Return Type

An roArray with every existing node without a parent created by the currently running app

### getRootsMeta() as Object

#### Description

Returns a string with every existing node without a parent created by the currently running app.

The existence of these unparented nodes means they are being kept alive by direct BrightScript references. These could be in variables local to a function, arrays, or associative arrays, including a component global m or an associative array field of a node. These unparented nodes are organized as an XML forest of trees.

#### Return Value

A string with every existing node without a parent created by the currently running app.

### getAllMeta() as Object

#### Description

Returns a string with every existing node created by the currently running app (similar to the [getAll()](#getall-as-object) method) organized as an XML forest of trees according to the usual parent-child node relationship. Cycles are handled with a reference entry in the tree rather than indefinite recursion.

#### Return Value

A string with the all the existing nodes created by the app.
