### 4.3 VOD video deliverables

All video masters should be delivered at specification unless agreed to with the Roku production team ahead of production.

If your image capture settings are not at the same data rate or higher of the export settings mentioned in 8.4.3, please reach out to Roku Post or let your Post Manager know. In order to prevent up-sampling, your final export should match the data rate that was captured (for example, if the camera captured ProRes 422, then final export should be ProRes 422 or equivalent).

#### 4.3.1 VOD video formatting

All files should be formatted to start at 00:00:00:00.

Files should begin with program and end on the last frame of the Roku Originals logo end card.

All video files **MUST NOT** contain any of the following: bars and tone, bumpers, segment recaps or previews, VITC time code, advertisements, slates, rating cards, FBI warning cards, placards, overlay branding, promotional bugs, informational bugs, watermarks, or website link callouts.

If promotional bugs or watermarks are required by a 3rd party, Roku Content Legal should be notified.

#### 4.3.2 VOD ad breaks

Each project will be required to deliver the VOD video master follows:

* All ads should be removed from the program.

* Ad breaks should be formatted as one second of black (no text permitted). Fade outs/ins are permitted.

The exact timecode of each ad break, in HH:MM:SS:FF format, will be required in both the Segment Rundown and Metadata deliverables. Both templates were provided in the Post Kickoff Deliverables Packet. Please reach out to Roku Post if you did not receive one.

#### 4.3.3 VOD audio formatting

For the Final Texted Masters, all audio should be contained within the delivered mezzanine file. See the audio settings listed in 2.3.4 for specifications based on delivery codec.

The audio channel mapping and tagging of metadata must be verified via a program like QuickTime 7, QuickTime Pro, Telestream Switch or Adobe Media Encoder for all texted and textless masters.

* If the audio is not labeled with the correct metadata (for instance if all channels are labeled as “C” or “Mono”) this will prevent ingest on Roku’s end and will need to be corrected and re-delivered.
* Incorrectly labeled audio can be manually adjusted in QuickTime Pro without a re-export.

Mixing Specifications:

* Target - 24 LKFS +/- 2 (any average between -22 & -26). Based on ITU-R 1170-3 measurement.
* Audio should not peak above -2 dBfs (True Peak)

#### 4.3.4 VOD texted video masters

#### 4.3.5 Textless delivery

Textless Reels/Masters are a Roku Original-specific deliverable. They provide our Marketing team with clean assets to use in preparation for the VOD launch (where applicable).

If your content includes burned-in on screen text, you will be required to deliver a separate Textless Reel or Full Episode. This reel should include clean, text-free versions of any shots that contain burned-in subtitles or graphic text elements. If the show contains a comprehensive graphics package, please strip all graphics and supply the graphics package or elements in Archival. Video and Audio specs should mirror the Texted Masters noted above.

Audio mapping label verification as noted in 2.4.2 must be verified in textless master.

Additionally, if foreign language subtitles cover 30% or more of a given episode, you will be required to deliver a fully textless version of that episode.

#### 4.3.6 VOD final proxy files (clean & visible timecode)

Proxy files are a Roku Original-specific deliverable. They are utilized by multiple internal teams both pre and post launch.

From each Texted Master created, please export following proxy files:

### 4.4 VOD audio delivery

Audio stems are a Roku Original-specific deliverable. Full audio stem delivery may not be required for each series. Please reach out to Roku Post Production to determine if your series will be required to delivery these materials. As content, formatting, and style will differ from one series to the next, Roku understands that stem delivery may also vary.

#### 4.4.1 Domestic episode stems

Provided below are the stems Roku would like to receive, if available (and applicable):

* Mono Dialogue, Music, and SFX stems
* Stereo Printmasters
* Stereo Music & Effects
* Stereo Music
* Stereo Dialogue
* Stereo Sound Effects

All audio should be archived as 24-bit, 48kHz WAV files. If Final Mix was 7.1, stems should be delivered as 7.1 as well. However, stem and master delivery to Roku must be in 5.1 and/or Stereo ONLY.

Please see section 4.2.3 for full guidelines on labeling audio files.

ShowCode_ProdNumber_Vers_LangCode_MaterialType_Channel#_SampleRate_BitRate_TC_Channel.mov

**Examples:**

MAMA_102_v04_enUS_PM_Nearfield_2ch_48k_24b_23976.L.wav

_Roku Best Practices_

* Roku requires that all music be cleared for both domestic and international use across all media on all devices.

### 4.5 VOD timed text file delivery

Roku Originals Live Event content should be delivered in each of the following timed-text formats in order to support the hearing impaired:

* Subtitles: Language solely (no inclusion of sound descriptors)
  * Foreign subtitle files should also include any translated forced narratives that are currently burned into picture in English

* SDH: Language in addition to sound descriptors (no forced narratives)

All timed-text files should be formatted to match the final VOD Video Master, not the live broadcast master. The files must have the same timecode and frame rate as the video and audio delivered.

Roku requires closed captions and subtitles in **SRT** formats. Character encoding MUST be UTF-8.

**Languages & Formats Required:**

English (American, Code: enUS): Subtitles, SDH, & FN

Spanish* (Neutral Latin American Spanish, Code: esMX): Subtitles (no SDH or FN necessary)

*If applicable, and dependent on Roku’s distribution rights

**All files should be labeled as follows:**

ShowCode-ProdNumber-LanguageCode_Format-RevisionDate

**Filename Examples:**

NION-101-esMX_SUB-20190701

NION-101-enUS_SDH-20190701

NION-101-enUS_FN-20190701

### 4.6 Paper deliverables

Roku’s External Deliverables Hub (“Hub”) is a centralized location for all wrap deliverables documents. If you have not been granted access and will be handling this portion of delivery, please reach out to your Post Manager.

#### 4.6.1 Roku metadata ingest template

Metadata allows Roku to ingest and display all series related information for our customers. Marketing and/or the Roku Content Executive may tweak the information to ensure it’s as effective as possible on the Roku platform.

* Show - Title, Description, Primary Spoken Language, Production Companies
* Season - Title, Description (leave blank if not applicable)
* Episode - Title, Production Number, Air Order, Total Run Time (TRT)

You will be required to deliver a detailed breakdown of the timecodes pertaining to all segments in each episode. Please utilize the Roku Segment Rundown Template provided in your Kick-Off Delivery Packet.

Roku requires that the timecodes within this document be delivered in HH:MM:SS:FF format. Any spreadsheets submitted without this formatting will not be accepted by Roku. 

#### 4.6.4 As broadcast scripts

Please deliver one set of As Broadcast Scripts for each series to the Hub. ABS files should reflect all changes made during the live broadcast, but do not need to be created by an outside vendor.

#### 4.6.5 Final font memo

Please deliver the final version of the Roku Delivery Checklist that you received in the Kick-Off Delivery Packet to the Hub. All of the following must be completed:

* All applicable file version dates and delivery locations for each asset
* Any assets not being delivered to Roku, as approved by Roku Post, should be identified as such within the “Delivery Destination/Notes” section of each deliverable
* If archival delivery will trail wrap, please indicate when it will be completed and who the primary point person will be to confirm for Roku Post

#### 4.6.7 Music cue sheets

Music Cue Sheets are required for all projects. Please use the cue sheet template found on the ASCAP website linked [here](https://www.ascap.com/help/royalties-and-payment/cue-sheets) or similar cue sheet template when submitting to Roku. The ASCAP template is also available via the Hub in the Production Legal – Scripted folder. Upload completed cue sheets to the Hub. If you have specific questions about Roku requirements for Music Cue Sheets, please contact Sydnee Grossberg at [sgrossberg@roku.com](mailto:sgrossberg@roku.com).

## 5. Archival

Archival delivery is not required for all Live Event content. Please reach out to Roku Post Production to determine if your series will be required to deliver these materials.

### 5.1 High resolution masters & source material

Any and all series that are wholly owned by Roku will require delivery of archival media (where applicable) via LTO7 or greater. LTOs should be formatted LTFs and include a digital manifest for each tape.

When adding assets to [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) folders, do not create additional sub-folders for episodes. Keep all media (proxies, texted/textless masters) only in the specified folder.

The following are required deliverables that must be uploaded to the Final Archive folder on [frame.io](http://frame.io/):

Required:
