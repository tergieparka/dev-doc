Apps with a profile selection screen can audibly and visually prompt the viewer to select a user profile and then handle a voice request with the name or position of the selected profile.

## Updating the manifest

To identify that your app supports a hands-free voice profile selection screen, add the following flag to the [manifest](doc:channel-manifest): `voice_action_launch_screen=1`.

## Implementing profile selector APIs

To implement voice support for a profile selection screen, integrate the following APIs:

* **Voice request trigger**. Upon launch, apps can call the [roAppManager.StartVoiceActionSelectionRequest()](doc:ifappmanager) function to trigger a voice request for the viewer to select a user profile on devices that are paired with a hands-free Roku Voice remote control, such as the Roku Voice Remote Pro.

  Before calling the **StartVoiceActionSelectionRequest()** function, developers can call the [roDeviceInfo.HasFeature("handsfree_voice")](doc:ifdeviceinfo#hasfeaturefeature-as-string-as-boolean) function to check whether a Roku device is paired with a hands-free Roku remote control.

  ```brightscript
  appMgr = CreateObject("roAppManager")
  deviceInfo = CreateObject("roDeviceInfo")
  ' channel is launched and profile selection screen is displayed
  if deviceInfo.HasFeature("handsfree_voice")
      appMgr.StartVoiceActionSelectionRequest()
  end if
  ```

* **Profile selection via registered/matched text strings**. Apps can call  the [roAppManager.SetVoiceActionStrings()](doc:ifappmanager) function to register a list of text strings, such as user profile names, that can be matched to voice requests.

  ```brightscript
  appMgr = CreateObject("roAppManager")
  profile1 = { text: "kids", link: "d46ge-i8Y5-192"}
  profile2 = { text: "Jane", link: "2a2Nu-u1D4-555"}
  profile3 = { text: "John", link: "6Nu70-N37x-901"}

  actions = [profile1, profile2, profile3]

  appMgr.SetVoiceActionStrings(actions)
  ```

  When the name uttered by the user matches the registered text string, the matched text string is provided to the app via the [roInput voice command handler](doc:ifinput). Specifically, if the **command** received by the handler is "action", the associative array returned by the [**roInputEvent.GetInfo()**](doc:roinputevent) method includes a **text** field that is set to the matched text string.

  ```brightscript
  function handleTransport(evt)
      cmd = evt.command
      ret = {status: "unhandled"}
      if cmd = "action"
          print "profile name uttered by user"
          print evt.text ' prints "kids", "Jane", or "John"
      end if
      return ret
  end function
  ```

  <br />

* **Profile selection via ordinal numbers**. The [roInput voice command handler](doc:ifinput) also supports profile selection via ordinal numbers. For example, when a user says "first", "number one", "pick the first", "select the first", "choose the first", and so on to select a user profile within a row, the app will receive a value of "1".

  Specifically, if the **command** received by the handler is "select", the associative array returned by the [**roInputEvent.GetInfo()**](doc:roinputevent) method includes a **ordinal** field that is set to a numerical value corresponding to the ordinal number spoken by the user. Values may range between 1–6 (one-based indexing is used).

  ```brightscript
  function handleTransport(evt)
        cmd = evt.command
        ret = {status: "unhandled"}
        if cmd = "select"
            print "Voice ordinal event"
            print evt.ordinal ' prints 1
        end if
        return ret
    end function
  ```

## Sample app

The [custom UI voice control sample (**Transport_Control_CustomUI**)](https://github.com/rokudev/transport-control) demonstrates how to add voice support to a profile selection screen.
