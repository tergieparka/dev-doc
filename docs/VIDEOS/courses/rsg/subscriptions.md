## About this lesson

This lesson describes how to monetize content by offering subscriptions, directly on-device, through Roku Pay. It explains how to get started with Roku Pay, including how to create an app, in-app products, and test users. It details the Roku Pay workflow from checking entitlements to completing purchases and granting access to content. It also summarizes how to integrate the Roku Web Service RESTful APIs into your backend system for validating, refunding, and canceling subscriptions.

The lesson then covers how to offer subscriptions in an app by integrating the Roku SceneGraph ChannelStore component. It explains how to use the ChannelStore APIs to get subscription products from the app's catalog, purchase products, and confirm purchases.  

This lesson also summarizes some of the app certification requirements for offering transactional content in an app.

> Apps offering subscriptions and one-time purchases must [implement Roku Pay](doc:overview) and adhere to all [Roku Pay certification requirements](doc:certification). Apps must integrate Roku Pay in all scenarios in which recurring or one-time payments are received.

## Sample app notes

### Steps required to play content

To play the videos in the [Subscriptions sample app](https://github.com/rokudev/scenegraph-master-sample/tree/master/Subscriptions), you need to use the [Roku Developer Dashboard](https://developer.roku.com/developer) to create an app and then configure the app and your developer account for testing. This entails the following steps:

1. [Create a test app](doc:channel-publishing-guide).
2. [Enable the app for billing testing](doc:billing-testing).
3. [Create in-app products](doc:product-catalog). You must create at least one in-app product that has a [free trial offer](doc:product-catalog).
4. [Add a test user](doc:test-users).

### Voiding test user transactions

To reset the purchasing workflow so that no in-app products are associated with your test user, go to the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.roku.com/users), select **Manage Test Users**, click **View** under the **Transactions** column, and then click **Void Transactions** to void the previous product transactions. This enables you to observe and re-test the app behavior when a user does not have an existing Roku subscription to access content.

### Video ads

This sample app builds upon the previous lesson, where video ads were inserted into the app content. For continuity in the sample app, the video ads implementation remains in the app code; however, if you are developing a subscription video on demand (SVOD) app, you may want to consider whether to display video ads in it.

In addition, to keep the app demonstration segments in this lesson concise and make them more comprehensible, the pre-roll ads that you will see when running the app have been edited out.
