When your app is tested and ready to deploy, you publish it using the Developer Dashboard. There are two types of app you can work with.

* **[Beta app](#beta-app-guidelines)**: A sharable app for testing without certification. A beta app is a temporary app for development purposes that cannot be published to the public Streaming Store.

* **[Public app](#public-app-guidelines)**: An app available for install from the Streaming Store. A public app must pass Roku's certification process and be reviewed by Roku before being published.

> When publishing an app, use the Roku developer account that belongs to the organization that owns the app content. If you hired a third-party app development company to build your app for you, do _not_ allow them to publish the app under their own account, otherwise ownership of the app will belong to them according to the terms of the [Roku Distribution Agreement](https://docs.roku.com/doc/DeveloperDistribution/en-us).
>
> In other words, when publishing an app, make sure that your own account is the **root account** associated with the app, and that your third-party developer has simply been granted the role of "Administrator" or "App management." Our document on [user access management in the Developer Dashboard](doc:user-access-management) provides more information on root accounts and role-based permissions.

## App creation overview

When you create an SDK app, you'll have the option of setting the app as a beta or public app. For either type of app, you'll start by [packaging your Roku app](doc:packaging-channels). Then follow the guidelines for creating a beta app or a public app.

Typically, you will first create a beta app to which you'll upload your package, and then you will share the app with your beta testers. Once you have finished testing and refining your app, you will create a public app using your tested package file. If you later make revisions to the public app that again require QA testing, you'll again use a beta app.

### Beta app guidelines

Beta apps are a special app type designed specifically to enable you to test your app in a production-like environment before publishing or pushing changes to a production application in the Streaming Store. Beta apps allow up to 20 beta test users to run the application on the Roku OS, making real calls to the Streaming Store, Roku Pay API, and other production services.

A beta app allows the developer to instantly revise an app for test users to try out. You just create the app and upload your package. You can then provide the app access code to your selected group of beta test users so that they can install and QA test your app. No certification testing is required for beta apps.

#### Beta app rules

Beta app usage is **limited** to its intended purpose of quality assurance, as follows:

* **120 days.** A beta app can exist for only 120 days after you create it (using [Add App](#create-an-app)). After the expiration of that period, the app is: (1) deleted and removed from your Developer Dashboard and (2) disabled for all users who have installed it.

* **10 apps.** Your developer account permits up to 10 beta apps at a time. For each beta app, you can:

* Update the beta app with new packages as needed; your beta testers will get automatic package installation without needing a new access code.

* Delete the beta app and create a new one replacing it; your beta testers will lose access to the original installation, and will need a new access code to access the new beta app.

* **20 users.** You can have up to 20 beta test users per beta app at any given time.

#### Beta apps vs. public apps

Additional differences between beta and public apps are summarized as follows:

|                           | Beta apps                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Public apps                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Certification testing** | **Not required.** Most of the certification tests available for Public apps are available for Beta apps. You should use them during beta development/testing, but none are required to pass before selected users can view the app. | **Required.** No Public app will be accessible by users unless it has passed all certification requirements.                                 |
| **Publishing**            | **Not allowed.** You submit a beta test app by simply uploading the package. There are no certification checks made.                                                                                                                | **Allowed.** Public apps may only be submitted for publishing once they pass certification testing.                                          |
| **Deployment**            | **Immediate.** Your beta test app is deployed immediately after upload of the package (unless errors in the package file prevent its deployment).                                                                                   | **Only after review.** Public apps are not deployed until the scheduled date.                                                                |
| **Access Code**           | **Immediately usable.** You send your beta test users an access code that allows them to install your test app on their Roku device.                                                                                                | **After publication.** The vanity access code you chose during app creation can be given to anyone to do a quick public app installation.    |
| **Streaming Store**       | **Not available.** Beta apps are not available for installation through the Streaming Store, or discoverable via Roku Search.                                                                                                       | **Available.** Published public apps are always available for installation through the Streaming Store and are discoverable via Roku Search. |

#### Creating a beta app

To create and start testing a beta app, you will need to:

1. [Package your Roku app](doc:packaging-channels).
2. [Create an app](#create-an-app) (select **Beta**).
3. [Upload the package](#package-and-testing) associated with this app.
4. Provide the Access Code (from the Preview and Publish window) to your beta testers.

For additional revision cycles before moving to a Public app, simply repackage your project using the same key and re-upload it to the same Beta app (if within the 120-day life of the app).

### Public app guidelines

Apps in the Streaming Store are certified before they are made available to the public. Some of the key benefits for public apps are:

* Displayed in a Streaming Store category (chosen during the submission process)
* Searchable by app name in Roku search.

Moreover, the Deep Linking and Roku Search feed information required for certification support:

* Home screen banner promotions
* Roku Search by content or person(s).

To ensure success in creating a Public app, you will need to:

1. [Package your Roku app](doc:packaging-channels).
2. Create your design assets following [Design and User Experience Guidelines](doc:design).
3. Go through the [Pre-certification Check List](doc:certification).
4. [Create an app](#create-an-app) (select **Public**).
5. [Upload the package](#package-and-testing) associated with this app.
6. Follow the [App certification](doc:certification) procedure.
7. Publish your app (submit it for deployment) using the [Publishing an app](#publishing-an-app) procedure.

2. In the **Languages** field, select one or more languages for which you will provide localized names, descriptions, and artwork. The assets displayed in the Streaming Store are based on the device's language settings. Providing localized app information helps increase the chances that customers will install your app.

   If you select multiple languages, a separate tab for each language is used for entering the properties (the currently selected tab is marked with a purple underline).

        If you select this option, you must enter the URL path to an app-ads.txt file in the <strong>Developer URL</strong> field to secure your app's ad inventory. If you do not sell ads via third parties or run programmatic ads on your app's inventory, it's recommended that you include the following line in the app-ads.txt file: "# [App Name] does not authorize programmatic sellers". For more information, see the [IAB documentation](https://iabtechlab.com/ads-txt/).<br /><img alt="channel-builder-2-monetization-options-video-ads - roku400px" src="https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-builder-2-monetization-options-video-ads.png" /><br />The <strong>Channel ID</strong> and <strong>Bundle ID</strong> values identify an app to the publisher's ad partners in the advertising ecosystem. These values can also be found via the meta-tags on the app's Streaming Store page. Following IAB App-Ads guidelines, Roku uses the meta-tags <code>appstore:store_id</code> and <code>appstore:bundle_id</code> to provide channel ID information in the http header of an app's Streaming Store page.
        <br /><br />
        Using the values from the illustration above as examples, the meta-tags would appear in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section, as so:
        <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;meta name="appstore:store_id" content="633666"&gt;
&lt;meta name="appstore:bundle_id" content="633666"&gt;</code></pre>
        Consider a scenario where you want to identify your app in an OpenRTB 2.5 Bid Request. You could use the following sequence for example:
        <pre><code class="language-json">"app": {
   "bundle": "633666",
   "storeurl": "https://channelstore.roku.com/details/374854f41bc07ae79db5f49add87d24c:673c4b59965ffef7ac2e74eefdaf94e6/roku-developers",
         …  &lt;additional fields&gt;
}</code></pre>
        The <strong>Developer URL</strong> field is also provided (and discoverable) in an app's Streaming Store page <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section:
        <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;meta name="appstore:developer_url" content="https://www.path.to/path"&gt;</code></pre>

Enter a minimum firmware version that is equal to or greater than the one required for the package format used by your app. |

3. Click **Save**.

### Deep linking

To validate that your app is handling deep link requests properly, provide at least one set of [deep linking parameters](doc:implementing-deep-linking) for each different [media type](doc:implementing-deep-linking#understanding-deep-linking-parameters) in your app. For example, if your app contains movies and TV episodes, include deep linking parameters for at least one movie and one episode.

> You must provide deep linking parameters, unless your app contains a single live feed. Apps submitted without deep linking parameters will not pass certification testing.

To enter deep linking parameters, follow these steps:

1. From the app's management page, click **Deep Linking**.

   ![channel-builder-2-deep-linking-selection - roku815px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-builder-2-deep-linking-selection.png)

2. For each set of deep linking parameters to be included in the certification test, click **Add deep link** (or **Add** if at least one deep link is already listed).

   ![channel-builder-2-deep-linking-start - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-builder-2-deep-linking-start.png)

3. Enter the following information in the **Add new deep link parameter** dialog, and then click **Save**:

   ![channel-builder-2-deep-linking-new-dialog - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-builder-2-deep-linking-new-dialog.png)

| Valid until   | Enter the last date when the deep linking parameters will be used in your app. Notice that, for a new parameter set, this field is pre-populated with a date that is one year in the future. You can change this date as needed. If the deep linking parameters do not expire, you can select the **Valid indefinitely** check box. |

4. The deep linking parameters are added to the list. You can edit and delete deep linking parameters in the list.

   ![channel-builder-2-deep-linking-added - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-builder-2-deep-linking-added.png)

### Static Analysis

The Static Analysis tool checks the app's code for the use of deprecated APIs, and noncompliance with certification criteria. Apps must pass Static Analysis testing to be submitted for certification. To run Static Analysis testing on your app, follow these steps:

1. From the app's management page, click **Static Analysis**.

   ![channel-builder-2-static-analysis-selection - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-builder-2-static-analysis-selection.png)

2. Click **Run analysis**.

   ![channel-builder-2-static-analysis-run-analysis - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-builder-2-static-analysis-run-analysis.png)

3. The window will update to indicate that analysis is underway and may take a few minutes to complete. When testing has been completed, the **Analysis results** screen opens and lists any error, warning, and info messages.

   ![channel-builder-2-static-analysis-results - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-builder-2-static-analysis-results.png)

4. For each message, the following information is provided. You can filter the test results based on the **Severity** or **Category**.

</Table>

For additional usage details and operational information, including a list of the tests conducted, see the [Static Analysis Tool](doc:static-analysis-tool) documentation.

### Test credentials

Developers of authenticated SVOD, AVOD, TVE, and free apps can enter the credentials for the account to be used for app testing. A test account is required to verify app functionality that can only be accessed after authenticating into the app. This includes, for example, testing on-device sign-up and sign-in workflows, measuring app performance, and validating deep links.

> This screen is only accessible if you selected **Yes** for the **Do customers sign in to your app** question in the **App Profile** page.

To provide the credentials for one or more test accounts, follow these steps:

1. From the app's management page, click **Test Credentials**.

   ![test-credentials-cb2 - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/test-credentials-cb2.png)

2. In the **Credentials Title** field, enter a descriptive name that makes the test account easy to identify.

3. Optionally, in the **Description** field, enter any notes related to the provided test account.

4. In the **Authentication Type** field, select the type of app: **SVOD** or **Cable/Satellite**. If you select **Cable/Satellite**, do the following:

   a. In the **Link URL** field, enter the URL for linking devices to the test account.
   b. From the **Provider** list, select the cable/satellite provider.

5. In the **Username** field, enter the user name to be used for static analysis testing.

6. In the **Password** field, enter the password to be used for static analysis testing.

7. In the **Valid until** field, enter the expiration date for the provided test account.

8. Click **Add**.

9. Repeat steps 2–8 for each additional set of account credentials to be provided for testing.

### App Behavior Analysis

Developers of SVOD, AVOD, and free apps can use the self-serve App Behavior Analysis tool to verify that their apps meet [performance](doc:certification) and [deep linking](doc:certification) certification requirements before submitting them for certification. This allows developers to get instant feedback on whether their apps meet specific deep linking and performance requirements, which reduces the wait time between submitting and publishing apps.

> To run the app launch performance test, your app must have the required [AppLaunchComplete signal beacon](doc:measuring-channel-performance).

To run App Behavior Analysis testing on your app, follow these steps:

1. From the app's management page, click **App Behavior Analysis**.

   ![channel-builder-2-cba-selection.png - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-builder-2-cba-selection.png)

2. If customers are required to sign in to your app, upload your [sign-in and sign-out test scripts](doc:authenticated-cert-testing) (unauthenticated apps can skip this step).

3. Click **Run**. Alternatively, you can scroll to the bottom of the **Preview and Publish** page that opens after you submit your deep linking parameters, click **App Behavior Analysis**, and then run the App Behavior Analysis test.

   ![channel-builder-2-cba-run-analysis - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-builder-2-cba-run-analysis.png)

4. Once you start the certification testing tool, the **Device** and **Firmware** fields lists the Roku test device in the cloud that is being used and the Roku OS running on it, respectively. The **Test progress** field includes a spinner indicating that the test is running, and the number of tests completed and the total tests to be run. Testing of apps is done in a first-in, first-out method; therefore, the certification testing of your app may be queued.

   ![img - roku815px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-builder-2-cba-running.png?version=1\&modificationDate=1687218897000\&api=v2)

5. When testing has been completed, the **Status** field displays "DONE" and shows that all the tests have been completed. If the **Status** field, displays "CANCELLED", "ERROR", or "UNAVAILABLE", click **Run** to re-run the test.

   ![img - roku815px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-builder-2-cba-analysis-complete.png?version=1\&modificationDate=1687219624000\&api=v2)

6. The **App Behavior Analysis** table lists the status of each individual test being executed. You can sort the test results by toggling the **Status**, **Severity**, or **Category** column headers. You can filter test results based on the same fields. This table includes the following columns:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

  </tbody>
</Table>

## Publishing an app

Once your public app has passed [Static Analysis](doc:static-analysis-tool) and [App Behavior Analysis](doc:channel-publishing-guide) testing, you can schedule it for publishing by following these steps:

1. Click **Schedule Publish** in the upper-right corner of the app management page. For beta apps, click **Publish**; this publishes the app and makes it available for up to 20 users to install it.

2. In the **Schedule app publishing** dialog, enter the date and time when you want your app to be published to the Streaming Store, and then click **Continue**. The earliest possible publishing time is the second business day from the current time, and is the default. Publishing can not be scheduled for Fridays or weekends.

   ![schedule-publish - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/schedule-publish.png)

3. Optionally, enter any release notes for this app version (maximum 1,500 characters), and then do the following:

   a. Select the **I confirm that** check box to confirm that you have tested your app per Roku App Publishing Checklist and your app complies with the listed agreements.

   b. Select the **I certify that** check box to confirm that you have the authority the submit the app, the provided listing information is accurate, and that you have the rights to distribute your app in the selected countries.

   c. Click **Submit**.

   ![schedule-publish-2 - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/schedule-publish-2.png)

4. The app will automatically be published at the specified time. During the app publishing process, you may receive the following emails:

   * A confirmation that your app has been submitted and its publication is scheduled for a particular date and time.
   * An announcement that your app has been published as scheduled.
   * If applicable, a notice that publication has been canceled (either by you or by Roku).

### Post-publishing

The following section summarizes when updates to the Streaming Store, Roku Search, and other platform features are propagated once a public app has been published or updated.

#### Streaming Store categories

After an app is published, it may be tagged with one or more categories. This includes the category selected and any other Roku-applied tags such as "New & Updated" or "Recommended"

An app is typically visible in the selected category after 5 minutes—if the category has less 1,000 apps. Otherwise, the app is not added to the category until it has been streamed by enough customers to move it up the popularity rankings in that category.

If the category is changed and the app is re-published, it takes approximately 5 minutes for the app to be switched to the new category. However, the app is only visible in that category if the aforementioned criteria is met.

For Roku-curated categories (for example, Featured Free), the app is typically visible after 5 minutes.

#### Other Streaming Store updates

The following items take approximately 5 minutes to be updated in the Streaming Store after the app is re-published:

* App added/removed to a country's Streaming Store after being enabled/disabled and the app being re-published.

* Localized versions of an app's name, description, or poster image are available in a country's Streaming Store where that localized language is the primary language.

* The "SERVICE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FEES" text being displayed in the app in the Streaming Store after being switched from Free to Paid.

* Updated app owner is displayed.

* App removed from Roku Streaming Store after it has been deleted.

#### Roku Search

Apps and their individual content items are typically added to Roku Search within 24 hours of the app being published.

#### Device installation

Once a public app is published to the Streaming Store, it is available for installation on Roku devices immediately using the app's vanity access code, which is specified in the [Properties window](#app-properties). To get the latest version of the app, users can do a System Update (Home > Settings > System > System update > Check now) or update the individual app (press the options key [*] on the app tile > Check for updates).

## Rolling back an app to the previous release

If you detect app performance issues following an update, you can revert the app to its previously published version using the self-serve rollback feature in the Developer Dashboard up to four days after the update. Rolling back an app deletes the current version and restores the previously published package. Once you roll back an app, the reverted version is deployed immediately, and will typically be installed on any devices with your app within six hours.

The app rollback feature has the following rules and requirements:

* **Eligible apps**. The self-serve rollback feature is only available for self-published apps.
* **User roles**. Only users with the root, admin, or app management role may do the rollback.
* **App versions**. An app can only be rolled back once to its previous version. For example, if you publish v3 of an app, you can only roll it back to v2. Once the app is rolled back to v2, you cannot roll it back to v1.  To return an app back to v3, you would need to re-submit the app through the standard certification and scheduling process.
* **Availability**: The self-serve rollback feature is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including weekends and holidays.
* **Time limit**.  After an app is published, it can be rolled back within four days. Once the four-day rollback eligibility period ends, the app cannot be reverted.
* **Streaming Store metadata**: Rolling back an app only reverts the package file, not its Streaming Store metadata. If you changed any Streaming Store listing or app properties in the current app version being rolled back, you will be prompted to confirm that the metadata should be reverted.

To rollback an app release, follow these steps:

1. Click the options menu in the upper right-hand corner and click **Rollback app** in the shortcut menu.

   ![channel-rollback-shortcut roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-rollback-shortcut.png)

2. The confirmation dialog displays the current app version and the previous version to which the app will be rolled back.

   ![channel-rollback-confirmation-dialog roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/channel-rollback-confirmation-v2.png)

3. If the previous app version was made for kids, click **Yes**.

4. Click **Yes** to complete the rollback.

5. In the app page, you can observe that the app version number is updated.

## Updating an existing app

To update an app, follow these steps:

1. On the **[Developer Dashboard](https://developer.roku.com/developer)**, select the public or beta app that needs to be updated.
2. Update any **Store listing** information and **App Properties**.
3. If the app code has changed, you need to generate a new package file and upload it from the **App package** page. Make sure to increment the app version number.
4. Run Static Analysis and App Behavior Analysis (if applicable) testing.
5. Schedule the app for publishing (public apps). If you are updating a beta app, publish the update.
6. If the updated app passes Roku's review, it is added to the Streaming Store on the scheduled publishing date. If the app fails the review, you will receive an email notification with the issues that need to be resolved in order for the app to be published.
