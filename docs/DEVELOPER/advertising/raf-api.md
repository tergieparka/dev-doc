## Construction

### Roku_Ads() as Object

This is the main entry point for instantiating the ad interface. This object manages ad server requests, parses ad structure, schedules and renders ads, and triggers tracking beacons.

The Roku ad parser/renderer object returned has global scope because it is meant to represent interaction with external resources (the ad server and any tracking services) that have persistence and state independent of the ad rendering within a client application.

## Control

### fireTrackingEvents(adStructure as Object, ctx as Object) as Boolean

#### Description

Triggers event tracking, including parameter substitution for Nielsen DAR, when library client code handles the ad rendering. This method can be used in scenarios where the RAF ad renderer is not used (for example, custom ad rendering or server-stitched ads).

#### Parameters

| Name        | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| adStructure | Object | Can refer to a pod (array) of ads or a single ad. Must at least contain a Tracking array member (see [Ad Structure example](doc:integrating-roku-advertising-framework)), and may optionally contain an ‘adServer’ member string. |
| ctx         | Object | Structure to capture context-specific trigger conditions. ‘type’ key-value pair used to trigger events of a specific type. ‘time’ key-value pair used to trigger time-dependent events at or prior to this time                   |

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether all beacons of the requested type were successfully fired.

### getAds(msg as string) as Object

#### Description

Gets the set of ads to be rendered now. This method may be called with no parameters or with a **msg** parameter.

* When called with no parameters, this function returns the full list of all ad pods parsed from the ad server response.
* When called with the **msg** parameter, this function can be used as an event listener in the client application’s main video playback loop to check whether midroll or postroll ads should be shown or not.

#### Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>msg</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Optional, depending on use case. Typically, this would be a message returned from a [WaitMessage()](doc:ifmessageport#waitmessagetimeout-as-integer-as-dynamic) call on the message port of the [roVideoPlayer](doc:rovideoplayer) object during content playback.<br /><br />This allows determination of which ads are scheduled for rendering based on playback position, user action, or other conditions.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Return Value

Available ad pod(s) scheduled for rendering or invalid, if none are available

### showAds(ads as Object, ctx as Object, view as Object) as Boolean

#### Description

Renders any ads scheduled for display.

When this method is called with an array of ad pods (for example, using the value returned from the initial call to the [getAds()](doc:raf-api) method), this is interpreted to mean that any preroll ad pod present should be rendered.

Client applications should always check the return value. If it is false, an application should exit content playback and return to the content selection screen. Typically, this occurs when the user presses the “Back” button during ad playback.

#### Parameters

<table>

    <tr>
      <th><strong>Argument</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Type</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Required</strong>?</th>

    <tr>
      <td>view</td>
      <td>renderable node</td>
      <td>required (for SceneGraph applications)</td>
      <td>Parameter representing a renderable node to which the ad UI can be parented.<br /><br />The <strong>view</strong> parameter allows SceneGraph rendering of ads into an app that uses SceneGraph for content rendering. <br /><ul><li>For server-stitched use case, this should be the Video node of the content player.</li><li>For non-stitched use cases, this can be any renderable node in the scene whose lifetime is guaranteed during the duration of ad rendering.

Having dimensions larger than the current video playback resolution can place RAF UI elements such as the progress bar off screen.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the ad pod was rendered to completion. This will be false if the user exited before render completion.

</table>

### setAdBreaks(contentLength as Integer, adBreakTimes as Integer)

#### Description

Configures content playback parameters, which can be used for scheduling relative-positioned ad breaks in VMAP ad service responses.

* If your application uses VMAP ad URLs and they are configured to use “nn%” timeOffset values, then you must specify the contentLength prior to calling [getAds()](doc:raf-api).
* If VMAP is configured to use “#mm” timeOffset values, you must first specify a set of ad break times.
* Calling with empty parameters will reset these to invalid values.

The content length can also be set independently via [setContentLength()](doc:raf-api) if ad break times are not required.

#### Parameters

| Argument      | Type    | Description                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| contentLength | Integer | Total length of video content (in seconds).                                        |
| adBreakTimes  | Integer | Array of suggested offsets into content playback to insert ad breaks (in seconds). |

### setAdExit(enabled as Boolean)

> setAdExit() is deprecated and disabled - check showAds() return value instead

### importAds(adPodArray as Object)

#### Description

Resets the internal ad pod cache to allow client code to import a set of ads from unsupported ad service response formats or when aggregating ads from multiple ad services.

The application is responsible for ensuring that the ad pods in the array contain all the required data members.

#### Parameters

| Argument   | Type   | Description                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| adPodArray | Object | Array of ad pods structured in accordance with the required [Ad Structure](doc:integrating-roku-advertising-framework). |

### enableJITPods(enabled as Boolean)

_Available since version 2.4_

#### Description

For applications that use a VMAP or SmartXML ad response to structure multiple ad pods, including midrolls, the JIT (or “Just In Time”) feature can be used to avoid pre-fetching all ad metadata before the content playback begins.

When enabled, ad call redirects for midrolls are deferred until a certain time before the ad pod is rendered. This mechanism relies on the host app’s continuous use of the BrightScript **getAds()** API method with the content video position event to determine when to resolve the deferred ads.

> JIT is used as a global setting; if the app has mixed content streams, where some content should not use JIT (such as server-stitched ads), then the host app is responsible for disabling this functionality before any ad calls are made for such streams.

#### Parameters

| Argument | Type    | Description                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| enabled  | Boolean | Enables “Just In Time” fetching of midroll ads. By default, JIT is disabled and must be explicitly enabled via this API. |

### enableInPodStitching(isIPS as Boolean)

_Available since version 2.14_

#### Description

"In-pod stitching" (IPS) mode brings some of the benefits from [CSAS API](doc:csas) to apps using the classic CSAI API [showAds()](doc:raf-api). When IPS mode is enabled and _showAds()_ is called for an ad break with multiple ads, it would stitch together the video clips for playback, prebuffering the next ad in the background while the current ad is finishing. The viewer experience is better because of the fast transitions between ads. Conversely, when IPS is disabled, each video plays individually and a few seconds are spent in a buffering screen between the ads.

#### Parameters

| Argument | Type    | Description                                            |
| :------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| isIPS    | Boolean | Whether to enable IPS (in-pod stitching) for showAds() |

### setLimitAdTracking(enabled as Boolean)

_Available since version 3.1_

For apps that collect explicit in-app consent for ad targeting (for example, to adhere to GDPR), this function specifies the value of the [ROKU_ADS_LIMIT_TRACKING URL parameter macro](doc:integrating-roku-advertising-framework) to be passed into beacons and ad requests.

This function cannot override the ROKU_ADS_LIMIT_TRACKING value if the customer has cleared the **Personalize ads** check box in the **Settings > Privacy** menu.

#### Parameters

| Argument | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| enabled  | Boolean | Sets the [ROKU_ADS_LIMIT_TRACKING URL parameter macro](doc:integrating-roku-advertising-framework) to be passed into beacons and ad requests to either 1 (true; ad targeting is disabled for the customer) or 0 (false; ad targeting is disabled for the customer). |

### setTrackingCallback(callback as Function, obj as Object)

#### Description

Allows library client to set a callback function to be called when ad tracking events are fired or checked.

Callback functions must have the following signature:

```brightscript
sub CallbackFunc(obj = invalid as Dynamic, eventType = invalid as Dynamic, ctx = invalid as Dynamic)
```

* The obj parameter is an opaque object always passed through to the callback.

* The eventType, if set, is a string specifying a tracking event that is fired. Event names correspond to [Tracking](doc:integrating-roku-advertising-framework).

* The ctx is an optional associative array that encapsulates metadata associated with VAST-specified macros or ad render progress. Each member of the ctx array should separately be considered optional (for example, client code should check for valid values before operating on these data members). Generally, if `ctx.eventType` is not set, then `ctx.time` should be set and indicate ad render progress:

  ```
  {
      errType: String,
      errCode: String,
      errMsg : String,
      time : Int | Float (playback position, in s),
      url : String (rendered asset URI),
      ad : Associative Array representing ad structure for current ad,
      adIndex: Int (logical index of current ad within ad pod)
  }
  ```

#### Parameters

| Argument | Type     | Description                                         |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| callback | Function | Function matching the required function signature . |
| obj      | Object   | The object to be passed to the callback function.   |

### setDebugOutput(enabled as Boolean)

#### Description

Enables a library client to configure extended debug output, which is disabled by default.

#### Parameters

| Argument | Type    | Description                     |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| enabled  | Boolean | Enables extended debug logging. |

### getLibVersion() as String

#### Description

Gets the RAF library version.

#### Return Value

The library version in the following format: “`<major>.<minor>`”

## General audience measurement

### enableAdMeasurements(enabled)

_Available since version 2.1_

#### Description

Applications using audience measurement features must explicitly enable the framework to operate on the custom impression tag parameters. This function is used in conjunction with the [setContentGenre()](doc:raf-api), [setContentId()](doc:raf-api), and [setContentLength()](doc:raf-api) APIs to provide measurement data to third-party ad measurement platforms such as NielsenDAR, ComScore CCR, and ComScore VCE.

> Contact [adsupport@roku.com](mailto:adsupport@roku.com) for more information on how to use audience measurement features.

#### Parameters

| Argument | Type    | Description                                       |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| enabled  | Boolean | Enables audience identifiers in measurement tags. |

### setContentGenre(genres as String, kidsContent as Boolean)

#### Description

Enables potential ad targeting by specifying a set of genre tags to associate with the content or the ad request.

To clear genre tags, pass an empty string in the **genres** parameter or omit it.

The semantics and implementation of targeting based on genre values are dependent on the configured ad server, but for a list of currently-supported tags supported by the Roku ad server, see [Roku Genre Tags](doc:integrating-roku-advertising-framework).

### renderStitchedStream(csasStream as Object, view as Object) as Boolean

#### Description

Renders a video stream that uses client-side ad stitching.

Tracking events are triggered automatically during ad rendering by this method.<br />For client applications that perform their own ad rendering, the valid event types that must be handled are represented in the `tracking` array of the [Ad Structure](doc:integrating-roku-advertising-framework).

For client-side stitched streams, the app will also get tracking events during content playback in addition to those received during ad rendering.

#### Parameters

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>view</td>
      <td>Object</td>
      <td>A renderable node to which the ad UI can be attached. This enables the rendering of ads for apps that use SceneGraph for content rendering.<br /><br />The dimensions of the view object will be used to position RAF's UI elements, so it must be properly sized. Having dimensions larger than the current video playback resolution can place RAF UI elements such as the progress bar off screen.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the stream played to completion. This is false if the user exited playback before the stream completed.

## Server stitched ads

### stitchedAdsInIt(adPodArray as roArray)

#### Description

Imports ad metadata to be used for server-stitched ad rendering and resets the internal state before handling events.

The application is responsible for ensuring that the ad pods in the array contain all the required data members. In particular, for server-stitched ads, all time-dependent tracking beacons (Impression and quartile beacons) must have a valid time data member set, with a value relative to the entire stitched stream. For example, if a 30-second ad starts at 10:00 within the stitched stream, its Impression beacons should have track.time = 600.0 and its Midpoint beacons should have track.time = 615.0, and so on.

This method is used in conjunction with [stitchedAdHandledEvent()](doc:raf-api) to implement ad rendering within server-stitched video streams.

#### Parameters

| Argument   | Type    | Description                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| adPodArray | roArray | Set of ad pods structured in accordance with the required [Ad Structure](doc:integrating-roku-advertising-framework). |

### stitchedAdHandledEvent(msg as Object, player as Object) as roAssociativeArray

#### Description

Determines whether a stitched ad is being rendered, lets the ad renderer attempt to handle the event, and returns metadata about the ad and the event handled state.

This method is only intended for use in rendering server-stitched ads.

The advertising framework must first be initialized using the stitchedAdsInit() method before calling this method.

#### Return Value

* If a stitched ad is being rendered, this method returns an roAssociativeArray that represents the current ad context and state. The return value is of the form:

  \{
  adIndex : Integer, 'Index of current ad within pod
  adPodIndex : Integer, 'Index of current pod
  evtHandled : Boolean, 'True if event was handled by ad renderer
  adExited : Boolean, 'True if user exited ad rendering
  adCompleted : Boolean, 'True if ad has completed rendering
  }

* If no stitched ad is being rendered, this method returns **Invalid**.

* If the return value indicates that there is a stitched ad being rendered and that the event was handled by the renderer, the client application must take no action on that event. If the ad was exited, the client app should stop playback and return to the content selection screen.

## Buffer screen customization

### setAdBufferScreenContent(contentMetaData as Object)

#### Description

```
{
  HDBackgroundImageUrl : String (URL for HD background image),
  SDBackgroundImageUrl : String (URL for SD background image),
  HDPosterUrl : String (URL for HD video poster),
  SDPosterUrl : String (URL for SD video poster),
  Title : String (Content title),
  Description : String (Content description)
}
```

#### Parameters

| Argument        | Type               | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| contentMetaData | roAssociativeArray | Contains metadata representing information to be displayed in the default ad buffer screen. |

### enableAdBufferMessaging(enableMsg as Boolean, enableProgressBar as Boolean)

#### Description

Enables the client application to display messaging text and a progress bar on the default ad buffer screen.

#### Parameters

| Argument          | Type    | Description                                                                                      |

| enableMsg         | Boolean | Enables ad messaging text on the default ad buffer screen. The default value is true.            |
| enableProgressBar | Boolean | Enables an ad buffering progress bar on the default ad buffer screen. The default value is true. |

### setAdBufferScreenLayer(zOrder as Integer, contentMetaData as Object)

#### Description

Enables the client application to set individual layer metadata for the custom ad buffer UI. contentMetaData conforms to the format defined in [Content Meta-Data](doc:content-metadata).

The values that can be passed in the **zOrder** and **contentMetaData** parameters are specified by roImageCanvas.

#### Parameters

| Argument        | Type               | Description                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| zOrder          | Integer            | Layer index to be used to display the **contentMetaData**. |
| contentMetaData | roAssociativeArray | The metadata for this UI layer.                            |

### clearAdBufferScreenLayers()

#### Description

Enables the client application to clear all metadata in all layers previously set for the custom buffer screen.

### setAdBufferRenderCallback(callback as Function, obj as Object, timeout as Integer)

#### Description

Enables the client application to set a callback function and timeout value for ad buffering events, to provide opportunity for analytics methods or animation of elements on custom buffer screen.
