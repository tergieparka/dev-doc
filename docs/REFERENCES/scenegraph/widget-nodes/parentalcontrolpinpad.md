ParentalControlPinPad is a variant of the [PinPad component](doc:pinpad), although it does have a few key differences: The pin, pinLength, and secureMode fields are made private (i.e., not accessible to BrightScript, and secureMode set to true).

There are two use cases for the ParentalControlPinPad node:

* If the user enters the correct pin, a 2-hour override of content blocking starts, similar to the system behavior on RokuTV
* If the user enters an incorrect PIN, the text fields are cleared automatically

## Fields

ParentalControlPinPad includes a new field, pinSuccess for blocking content:

        Specifies whether or not the pin display that shows the entered digits is visible. In most cases, it is desirable to display the entered digits so that the user can see the string as it is entered. In some cases though, you might want to only show the keyboard part of the PinPad node.<br /><br />In those cases, the pinfield of the node will still contain the string entered by the user, so that it can displayed in some different manner.
