## Verifying no entitlement without a Roku Pay subscription

To verify that a customer cannot be entitled to content without a subscription purchased through Roku Pay, follow these steps:

1. Launch app and select content behind paywall.

2. Send the [**getAllPurchases** command](doc:channelstore#getallpurchases). Verify that it does not return any active subscription products.

3. Call the **[roRegistrySection.read()](doc:ifregistrysection)** function on the device registry section for the app. Verify that it does not return an access token from device registry.

4. Send the [**getChannelCred** command](doc:channelstore#getchannelcred). Verify that it does not return an access token from Roku cloud.

## Verifying Roku Pay purchase workflow

To verify that a customer can purchase a subscription product and upgrade/downgrade their plan through Roku Pay, follow these steps:

1. Send the [**getCatalog** command](doc:channelstore#getcatalog). Verify that the SceneGraph components used to display in-app products are populated with product metadata.

2. Select a subscription product. Verify that the [**getUserData** command](doc:channelstore#getuserdata) is sent and the request for information (RFI) screen is displayed.

3. Press **Continue** on the RFI screen. Verify that the [order is created](doc:channelstore#order) and the [**doOrder** command](doc:channelstore#doorder) is executed.

4. Verify that the order confirmation screen displays any free trial offers or discounts included with the subscription product.

5. Confirm the order of the subscription product. Verify that the `orderStatus` field confirms that the order was successfully completed.

6. Verify that an access token is generated in the publisher's backend system and passed into:

   a. The [**storeChannelCredData** command](doc:channelstore#storechannelcreddata) to store the access token in the Roku cloud.

   b. The **[roRegistrySection.write()](doc:ifregistrysection)** function to store the access token in the device registry.

7. If your app includes a [product group](doc:product-catalog#creating-product-exclusivity-groups), select another in-app product that is in the same product group as the previously ordered one. Verify that the "You're already subscribed" dialog is displayed.

8. Call the [**validate-transaction** API](doc:roku-web-service#validate-transaction) with purchase ID included in the `orderStatus` field. Verify that the `isEntitled` flag is set to "true".

9. If your app includes multiple subscription plans, upgrade or downgrade the subscription plan, and then do the following:

   a. Verify that the `order.action` field is set to the correct string.

   b. Call the `validate-transaction` API with purchase ID included in the `orderStatus` field. Confirm the following:

   * The `purchase_type` is set to `UPGRADE` or `DOWNGRADE`.

   * The `cancelled_transaction_ids` field is set to the transaction ID of the original subscription purchase.

   * The `purchase_status` field is set to `active`.

10. Close the app.

## Verifying Roku Pay entitlement workflow

To verify that a customer is entitled to content after purchasing a subscription through Roku Pay, follow these steps:

1. Re-launch app.

2. Send the [**getAllPurchases** command](doc:channelstore#getallpurchases). Verify that it returns the purchased subscription product.

3. Call the [**validate-transaction** API](doc:roku-web-service#validate-transaction) with purchase ID included in the `purchases` field. Verify that the `isEntitled` flag is set to "true".

4. Call the **[roRegistrySection.read()](doc:ifregistrysection)** function on the device registry section for the app. Verify that it returns an access token from the device registry.

5. Send the [**getChannelCred** command](doc:channelstore#getchannelcred). Verify that it returns an access token from Roku cloud.

6. To test that customers are not entitled to subscription products after a free trial ends, do the following:

   a. Order a subscription product that has a 1-day free trial.

   b. After the trial expires the next day, cancel the subscription.

   c. Complete steps 1-3. Verify that the `isEntitled` flag is set to "false".
