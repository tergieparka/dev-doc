You can use the Roku Pay Transaction Report in the Developer Dashboard to view and analyze transactions on your app. The report lets you query and analyze historical purchases, refunds, renewals, and cancellations. You can view the generated report in your web browser, or you can export or email the report as a spreadsheet, tab-separated text (TXT) file, comma-separated value (CSV) file, or as a chart.

The data compiled in the Transaction Report enables a number of critical use cases. This includes [estimating annual and monthly subscription revenue](#estimating-monthly-subscription-revenue-with-the-transaction-report), which you can then use to reconcile payouts received.

## Opening the Transaction Report

To open the Transaction Report, go to the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.roku.com/developer), click **Sales reports** in the left sidebar, click the **Transactions** tab, and then select the app for which you want to view the transactions. Alternatively, you can directly access the report at https://analytics.roku.com/analytics.

## Running a Transaction Report

To run a Transaction Report, follow these steps:

1. Specify the time period for the Transaction Report. By default, the report includes data from the previous week (8 days ago for 7 days). To select a different time period, expand **Filters** and then configure the period. You can select a specific date, the last _x_ days, a year, a specific time range, all the dates or or after a specific date, and so on. You can also use <Anchor label="filter expressions" title="Looker Filter Expressions" href="https://docs.looker.com/reference/filter-expressions">filter expressions</Anchor> by selecting **matches (advanced)**.

   Optionally, you can include additional criteria in the query by clicking the add icon and configuring another time period. For example, you can create a query that includes transactions for the first quarters of the last two years. Click the delete icon to remove a time period from the query.

   > A report may include transactions dating back to January 1, 2018.

## Estimating monthly subscription revenue with the Transaction Report

You can use the Transaction Report to estimate the monthly payouts from subscription purchases and reconcile the estimates with the actual payouts received. To estimate your monthly subscription revenue, follow these steps:

1. Run a Transaction Report for the last 13 months or the previous month.

   * If this is the first time you are doing the estimate and you have annual subscriptions, run a Transaction Report for the last 13 months (payouts are sent approximately 30 days after the end of a month; therefore you need to use a 13-month period to calculate payouts for the last 12 months). To do this, set the **Time Period** in the **Filter** to **"is in the past"** **"13" "months"**, or select **is in range** and enter the 13-month time period.

   * If you are just estimating the previous month's subscription revenue, set the **Time Period** in the **Filter** to **"is in the past"** **"1" "months"**, or select **is in range** and enter the 1-month time period.

2. Separate the monthly and annual subscription transactions. Filter on a field in the report that distinguishes between monthly and annual subscriptions. This may be the **product_code** or **product_name** field, if you included "monthly" or "annual" in the name, or it can be the **net_amount** as it is likely that your annual subscriptions have distinctive prices compared to the monthly ones.

3. Calculate the monthly subscription revenue. In the list of monthly subscription purchases, sum the revenue and multiply the total by 0.80 (based on 80% share of the subscription revenue).

> Payouts for monthly subscription revenue are typically sent the next month; therefore, your January monthly revenue would be sent in February, February revenue in March, and so on.

The following table demonstrates how the **product_name**, **product_code**, and **net_amount** fields may be used to identify monthly subscriptions and then how to calculate the amount of revenue that will be paid out the following month. Only the first 3 of 300 hypothetical monthly subscriptions are shown.

| product_name | product_code | net_amount | 80% Revenue Share (paid out next month) |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| App 1        | monthly_sub  | $5.00      | $4.00                                   |
| App 1        | monthly_sub  | $5.00      | $4.00                                   |
| App 1        | free_trial   | $0.00      | $0.00                                   |
| App 1        | free_trial   | $0.00      | $0.00                                   |
| App 1        | monthly_sub  | $5.00      | $4.00                                   |
| **Total**    |              | **$1,500** | **$1,200**                              |

4. Calculate the annual subscription revenue for each month.

   a. In the list of annual subscription purchases, filter on the **event_date** field to identify the new annual subscriptions were purchased during the first month in the 13-month range.

   b. Sum the revenue from the new annual subscriptions for the month, multiply the total by 0.80 (based on 80% share of the subscription revenue), and then divide the product by 12 (annual subscription revenue payments are prorated over 12 months). To simplify this, you can multiply the total annual subscription revenue by 0.0667 (.8 X 1/12) to get the monthly annual subscription revenue.

   c. Attribute the prorated monthly annual subscription revenue you calculated to each of the next 12 months. For example, if $3,600 of annual subscription revenue was generated in January, $2,400 in February, and $1,200 in March, then your January monthly annual subscription revenue would be $300, February would be $500, and March would be $600, and so on.

   d. Repeat these steps for each subsequent month, summing the annual subscription revenue attributions for each month.

The following example demonstrates how new annual subscriptions are attributed to monthly revenue for a new app launched in January. The two left-most columns in the table record the new annual subscription revenue generated for each month within a year. The month columns to the right list the pro-rated annual subscription revenue that is attributed to the subsequent months. For example, the table shows $3,600 new annual subscription revenue for January, which is paid out in equal $300 installments from February to the next January (not shown).

| New Annual Subscription Revenue |        | Jan | Feb      | Mar      | Apr      | May        | June       | July       | Aug        | Sep        | Oct        | Nov        | Dec        |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | --- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| January                         | $3,600 |     | $300     | $300     | $300     | $300       | $300       | $300       | $300       | $300       | $300       | $300       | $300       |
| February                        | $2,400 |     |          | $200     | $200     | $200       | $200       | $200       | $200       | $200       | $200       | $200       | $200       |
| March                           | $1,200 |     |          |          | $100     | $100       | $100       | $100       | $100       | $100       | $100       | $100       | $100       |

| May                             | $3,000 |     |          |          |          |            | $250       | $250       | $250       | $250       | $250       | $250       | $250       |

5. Use the calculations from steps 3 and 4 to add the monthly and pro-rated annual subscription revenue to estimate the expected payout for a month. The following table uses the first three months of a year to demonstrate how to do this:

| Month    | Monthly Subscription Revenue <br />(from previous month) | Pro-Rated Annual Subscription Revenue<br />(from previous 12 months) | Total Expected Payout |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| February | $1,200                                                   | $300                                                                 | $1,500                |
