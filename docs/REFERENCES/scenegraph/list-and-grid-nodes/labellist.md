Extends [**ArrayGrid**](doc:arraygrid)

The LabelList node class is a simple list class that can be used to display a list of items. Each item can include a text string and an optional icon positioned to the left of the text string.

The list items can be organized into sections that are demarcated by labelled horizontal divider lines between the sections.

In most cases, you will want to populate the content of a LabelList (or other similar components like PosterGrids, etc.) from a content feed, web service API, or some other dynamic data source.  However, to illustrate the basics of how a LabelList is constructed and used, here is a simple example of creating a LabelList and populating it with static data.  Static data in a LabelList may be useful for app screens such as settings or menus with fixed items.

**Static LabelList configuration**

```xml
<LabelList
  id="moviemenu"
  translation="[160,92]"
  itemSize="[440,48]">
  <ContentNode id="moviemenucontent" role="content">
    <ContentNode title="Drama" />
    <ContentNode title="Action" />
    <ContentNode title="Horror" />
    <ContentNode title="Comedy" />
  </ContentNode>
</LabelList>
```

**Example**

This code renders the LabelList shown below.

In this screen shot, the user has scrolled down one item to highlight "Drama" showing the separator after the last list item.

## Data bindings

The data model for the LabelList node should have a single ContentNode as the root node in its content field. The structure of the rest of the data model depends on whether or not the list items are to be grouped into sections.

**List Items Not Being Grouped Into Sections**

If the list items are not to be grouped into sections, one child ContentNode should be added to the root node for each item in the list (these child nodes can be thought of as _item nodes_). Item nodes should have their ContentNode attributes set as shown in the table below.

| Attribute                   | Type   | Description                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TITLE`                     | string | The label for the list item                                                                                      |
| `HDLISTITEMICONURL`         | uri    | The image file for the icon to be displayed to the left of the list item label when the list item is not focused |
| `HDLISTITEMICONSELECTEDURL` | uri    | The image file for the icon to be displayed to the left of the list item label when the list item is focused     |

**List Items Grouped into Sections**

If the list items are to be grouped into sections, one child ContentNode should be added to the root node for each section in the list (these child nodes can be thought of as _section roots_). Each section root should contain one child ContentNode for each item in the section (that is, item nodes). Each item ContentNode uses the same attributes as the item nodes when there are no sections, as shown in the table above.

The section root ContentNodes use the following attributes:

| Attribute         | Type   | Description                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CONTENTTYPE`     | string | Must be set to `SECTION`                                                                                              |
| `TITLE`           | string | Label for the section divider                                                                                         |
| `HDGRIDPOSTERURL` | uri    | The image file for the icon to be displayed to the left of the section label when the screen resolution is set to HD. |
| `SDGRIDPOSTERURL` | uri    | The image file for the icon to be displayed to the left of the section label when the screen resolution is set to SD. |
