## Texture memory

A common offense is simply using too much texture memory. It's important
to realize that simply using a larger image does not necessarily ensure
a higher quality end result. Rather, using unnecessarily large images
will more often than not result in performance issues. All Roku devices
have a dedicated amount of texture memory, which varies from
device to device. Each *unique* image you would like to display on your
app will take up a certain amount of the limited texture memory
(however, reusing the same image on multiple nodes will not take up more
memory). More specifically, the **size in bytes** of the image file does
not matter (so compressing your images is inconsequential), rather,
the **pixel dimension** of the image is important. Images are
loaded into texture memory in the form of bitmaps, taking up 4 bytes per
pixel (RGBA). A quick calculation (width x height x 4B) can help you
approximate how much texture memory your images will be taking up.

If your app ends up going over any of these limits by trying to
display more than what the texture memory can allow for, then your
app will run into unexpected behavior on those devices. A common
symptom is flickering images or slow content loading, as bitmaps will be
constantly unloaded and reloaded onto memory in an effort to manage the
excess images. Even if your images do not use up all the texture memory
on a device, your app will load slower in general if it contains
larger images.

### How to see texture memory

1.  Side load your app using one of the normal methods
2.  Run your app and navigate in the UI to where you think there
    might be an issue.
3.  telnet to your roku at port 8080.
4.  If your app is SceneGraph run this command: "loaded_textures". Be aware that there is a texture cache, so images that are not visible can be cleared automatically.
5.  if your app is pre-SceneGraph, 2D API or template,  run this
    command: "r2d2_bitmaps."

### How to avoid going over memory limits

#### Make images smaller

The simplest solution\! If you're planning on displaying an image on a
200x200 Poster node, don't load in and render a 1920x1080 image. It will
work, but it'll be a waste of system resources for no real benefit. A
quick calculation puts a 1920x1080 image at using a whopping
(1920•1080•4 = **~8.3MB**) of memory, while the appropriately sized
200x200 image will only take up **~0.16MB**. Using the loadWidth and
loadHeight fields of a Poster node would be an equivalent solution to
resizing the images themselves.

#### Use minimalistic item renderers

The fewer elements, the better.
Use [Rectangle](doc:rectangle) nodes,
which do not require a bitmap loaded into memory,
over [Poster](doc:poster) nodes
whenever possible. Keep in mind that even bitmaps for elements like
focus rings and keyboard backgrounds take up texture memory - so take
care to not use unnecessarily large images for these.

### Debugging texture memory performance

Using r2d2*bitmaps to check the amount of texture memory
available:*

You can check your texture memory usage by telnetting to port 8080 on
your Roku device and running the command “r2d2\_bitmaps”. This command
will output a list of memory addresses representing the assets loaded
into texture memory, their width and height, as well as their size in
bytes. At the bottom, it also shows the available memory you have on
your device left, the amount used, and the amount that the device has in
total. If your app uses multiple high resolution images (e.g. more
than two 1920 x 1080 images), you will notice that the available memory
will hit a peak somewhere less than the max amount and keep fluctuating
between values as the texture memory manager tries offloading assets and
reloading them back in to manage memory. Make sure to use the
performance techniques listed in this guide so that your app doesn't
run into these problems\!


## System memory (DRAM)

  - Roku devices have anywhere from **512 MB DRAM** on the lowest end
    devices, to **2.0 GB DRAM**.
    
  - While many applications like **image processing or 3D modeling
    software** benefit greatly from a large amount of RAM, this is
    usually not the case for apps running on Roku OS.

  - For well-written apps, **RAM will not be a bottleneck for
    performance**.

  - An app is far more likely to hit the texture memory or CPU
    ceiling than to ever run out of RAM, and your app is sandboxed
    such that the Roku device will always allocate and save enough RAM
    for video buffering. In addition, if your app uses a large
    amount of RAM it will simply be killed before
    performance hits are noticeable.

### Viewing system memory

You can view system memory usage multiple ways:

- Use the [Roku Resource Monitor](https://devtools.web.roku.com/roku-resource-monitor)

- Telnet to `port 8080` and run `sgnodes all`
- Telnet to port 8085, press **^C** to break into the debugger, and run `bcs` or `bscs`.
