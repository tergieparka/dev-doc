The Payout Audit Report displays information, including monthly transaction amounts and deferred payouts, which partners can use to reconcile their apps' revenue activity with receipts from Roku Accounts Payable. Revenue events are expressed using the currencies originally involved. Both net revenue share and original amounts collected by Roku are reported.

## Opening the Payout Audit Report

To open the Payout Audit Report, go to the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.roku.com/developer), click **Sales reports** in the left sidebar, click the **Payout Audit** tab, and then select the app for which you want to view the transactions and payouts.

## Running the Payout Audit Report

Whenever the user chooses an app from the drop-down list of apps (see "Transaction Channel ID," below), the report begins running for that app, using default **Filters**. Click **Run** to produce another report for the same app, after changing the **Filters**.

## Filters

* **Channel ID** – Indicates the app, for which earnings are shown in the report.
* **Currency** – Restricts the display to reflect only transactions that are denominated in the specified currencies.
* **Payout Month** – Determines the interval for which earnings are reported. In the screenshot below, the user has specified that the report must include all transactions with a date that contains "2019-01" (in other words, transactions for the month of January, 2019).

## Screenshots

The Payout Audit Report displays only a tabular grid, in which each row represents an individual transaction. Each row includes the following columns:

* **Event Date** – The date of the transaction (in [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format).

* **Invoice Number** –The Roku-generated unique ID for the transaction. This invoice number is included in purchase confirmation emails sent to customers. It can be used as a lookup key for customer queries or requests.

* **Transaction Type** – The nature of the transaction, as explained in the table below:

  | Type               | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Availability

The Payout Audit  report is available to all apps that conduct transactions through Roku, regardless of region.

## Using the Payout Audit Report to reconcile app activity with Roku payments

When reconciling the amount paid by Roku for a given month with the app transactions for that month, we recommend the steps below:

1. Run the report for your chosen **Payout Month.**
2. Export the data to a spreadsheet file. (See "Exporting report data," below.) Then open the file in your spreadsheet program.
3. In a freestanding blank cell, compute the total of the **Partner Rev Share** column. This should match Roku's payment (after accounting for exceptional circumstances, such as a withholding obligation).
4. Remember that the **Partner Rev Share** is always reported in the local **Currency**, but Roku pays in usd. So the final step of payment reconciliation is to convert the total from the local currency to usd.

To determine the portion of the month's payment which is caused by _deferred_ amounts, only include in the total those **Partner Rev Share** amounts where the **New or Deferred** column contains "deferred". Similarly, the portion of the month's payment that results from _new_ transactions will be the total of **Partner Rev Share** amounts where the **New or Deferred** column contains "new".

> **Withholding:** Non-US developers please note: Once you have followed the above procedure, should the total of new revenue plus deferred revenue for the selected interval be significantly greater than the Roku payments made for that period, check to see if there is a locally imposed or other kind of external tax, which Roku is obliged to withhold. If so, adding that amount to the corresponding payment from Roku should yield the total of new and deferred revenue, as shown in the Payout Audit  report.

## Exporting report data

To export data from the Payout Audit Report,  follow the steps below:

1. Set **Filters** properly and run the report, as described above.

2. Click the "three-dot" (**...**) button in the upper-right portion of the generated report's table-heading. Choose **Download Data...**

3. The Download dialog appears. The **File Format** field provides several output options, some of which include Excel worksheet (Excel 2007 or later), and CSV. For example, choose CSV:

4. Make sure that **All Results** is the selection in the **Limit** field, as shown above, _or the full range of data may **not** be exported._

5. If desired, change the default **Filename** to something else.

6. Click **Download**.
