Extends [**Group**](doc:group)

The Poster node class draws an image with the top/left corner located at the origin of the node local coordinate system. Because the Poster node class extends the Group node class, a Poster node can have child nodes. For example, a Poster node might have a Label node as a child that draws an annotation on top of the poster.

The Poster node class supports JPEG, PNG and (since [Roku OS 9.4](doc:release-notes#roku-os-94)) [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) image files. Please observe [Special WebP considerations](doc:media#special-webp-considerations) when using the latter.

The Poster node class includes the capability to automatically scale graphical images to different sizes as they are loaded, by setting the loadWidth and loadHeight field values. After the graphical images are loaded, the images can be scaled to fit within the target screen element area specified by the width and height field values. To use this capability, select the scaling option you want as the value of the loadDisplayMode field.

See SceneGraph's [Texture Memory](doc:memory-management) feature for more information.

> In order for the load scaling options to work, the option fields must be set in XML markup before the uri field

### Best Practice when using this node

* Avoid loading either very large images (larger than the target screen dimensions), or very small images, with the intent of the Roku OS scaling to a certain design intention. These can cause an unsatisfactory appearance, or even application issues such as degraded performance.

* For the best appearance and application performance load images either identical to, or close to, the intended target screen dimensions of the Poster node in your application design.

* Set the dimensions of an image in your design by setting the Poster node width and height fields.
  If you do not set these fields, designs implemented in certain forms of XML markup may not render as intended, unless you use an explicit callback layout function triggered by the Poster node loadStatus field, to render the screen element after the image has loaded and the dimensions are known.

### Example

The following example is a poster image placed using Poster node:

<Image alt="roku815px - poster-node-sample" border={false} src="https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/poster-node-sample.png" title="poster-node-sample" />

The following displays a graphic image from the application images directory near the top left of the display screen.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<component name="postertest" extends="Group">
  <script type="text/brightscript">
    <![CDATA[
      sub init()
        m.top.setFocus(true)
      end sub
    ]]>
  </script>

  <Poster
    id="testPoster"
    uri="pkg:/images/rokuowds.png"
    width="0.0"
    height="0.0"
    translation="[160,8]" />
</component>
```

### Autoscaling

When autoscaling between FHD/HD, there may be cases where using images with widths or heights that are not divisible by 2 (i.e. even numbers) do not work correctly.

### Rotation

Rotation of Posters is supported. On platforms that do not support OpenGL, only rotations of 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees are supported.

## Fields

[Fields](doc:group)  derived from the Group base class can also be used.
