Publishers can integrate add-ons in their apps to offer customers premium content, additional apps, and other upgrades and features, and they can bundle add-ons with base subscriptions. By integrating add-ons, customers can complete the purchase of all desired products and features for their subscription online and directly on-device with just a few key presses. This enables publishers to maximize subscription revenue through upsells, without any additional friction in the purchase workflow.

> An add-on is defined as a service purchased on top of a base subscription product.

Integrating add-ons entails the following steps:

1. Creating add-on products in the Developer Dashboard. A product represents a set of content (for example, a premium app or app package) or other features offered by your app. **You must upgrade to Product Catalog 2.0 to create add-ons** (see [Creating the Product Catalog](doc:product-catalog) for how to migrate the In-app purchase workflow in the Developer Dashboard to the new Product Catalog 2.0 experience).

2. Creating purchase options for the add-on. A purchase option specifies the billing frequency (monthly, quarterly, or annual), price, and any free trial or introductory price offers for the add-on product.

3. Update the app with new ChannelStore APIs that support add-ons.

## Creating add-on products

Publishers need to create a product in the Developer Dashboard for each add-on to be offered in their app. To create an add-on product, follow these steps:

1. In the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.roku.com/developer), select **Product Catalog** under **Monetization**. You can also select **Manage Product Catalog** from the drop-down list on the left side of the pages within the Developer Dashboard. The **Product Catalog** page opens.

   ![img - roku815px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/add-on-add-product.png)

2. From the **Product List** tab, click **Add Product**. The **Add Product** page opens.

   ![img - roku815px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/add-on-product-details.png?version=1\&modificationDate=1700090583000\&cacheVersion=1\&api=v2\&width=600\&height=735)

3. Enter the following information for the add-on product:

   | Setting                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Product name              | Select a locale and then enter the product name. This name is used in Roku Pay reports, and it is displayed to customers for product bundles only. The list of available locales is based on the languages selected in the [Channel Properties window](doc:channel-publishing-guide). To provide additional localized product names, click **Add product name in another language**, select a locale, and then enter the localized product name. You can provide one product name per locale. |
   | Internet required         | Accept the default setting, which is **Yes**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
   | Product Id                | The internal code for the add-on product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
   | It is an add-on           | Enable this setting, and then select the prerequisite base products. Add-ons are only accessible in the customer flow if the required base products have already been purchased or are being purchased at the same time as the add-on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
   | Product exclusivity group | Product groups are required for each set of mutually exclusive add-ons offered by your app. This enables customers to avoid being double billed for access to the same content or service. If customers cannot purchase this add-on while being entitled to another add-on, enable this. If an add-on has multiple prerequisite base products, those base products must be in a product group.                                                                                                |

4. Click **Save and create purchase option** to create one or more purchase options for the add-on immediately after saving the product.

5. Accept the default purchase option, which is **Subscription**, and then click **Continue** to create the purchase option for the add-on.

   ![img - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/rpay-catalog-purchase-type-dialog-no-cross-bundle.png)

You can create a subscription bundle that includes two base products or a single base product and one or more add-ons. To do this, click **Subscription bundle** and then select the products to be packaged together from the **Product** list. You may only select products that are not in the same product group. Click **Add another product to bundle** to include additional products in the bundle. Add-on products can only be bundled with their prerequisite base products.

## Creating purchase options for add-ons

Once you have created an add-on product, you create one or more purchase options for it. A purchase option specifies the billing frequency (monthly, quarterly, or annual), price, and any free trial or introductory price offers for the add-on.

To create a purchase option for an add-on product, follow these steps:

1. From the **Product** list, select the add-on product for which you are creating a purchase option.

2. Configure the following **Purchase Details** settings:

   | Display name            | A 30-character maximum name of the purchase option. This name will be displayed to customers in the app's on-device purchasing workflow and in subscription emails sent by Roku.<br /><br />The name can include letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation marks (UTF-8 characters are not supported for product names in English). The display name should include the name of the app, and it should make it easy for customers to identify the product (for example, "Roku Developers - Ad-Free").<br /><br />Do not include any billing information in the name (for example, billing frequency, price, or trial/discount); the Roku platform UI will automatically display this information to customers. |

             <li><strong>Introductory price</strong>. Include a discount with the purchase option. In the <strong>Introductory period</strong> box, enter the number of days, months, or years the introductory price is valid, and then select the pricing tier corresponding to the discounted price to be offered from the <strong>Price</strong> list. Discounts cannot be specified using percentages or absolute currency units (for example, USD). Discounts may only be specified using the appropriate price tier. For example, the absolute discount from tier 9 to tier 6 is $3.00 ($8.99-5.99); the percentage discount is 33.4% ($(1-(5.99/8.99))x100).</li>

   </Table>

4. Click **Save as Draft** to save the purchase option without publishing it. Click **Publish** to activate the purchase option on your app.

5. If you selected **Publish** in step 6, review the **Purchase details** and **Billing plan** settings, and then click **Confirm** to make the purchase option available to customers on your app. After you create an add-on, you can schedule limited-time offers and schedule price changes for it (see [Creating the Product Catalog](doc:product-catalog) for how to do this).

## Updating the app

Publishers need to update their app's code to leverage the new **GetAllPurchases**, **GetCatalog**, **QueryPuchaseOptions**, and **DoOrder** ChannelStore APIs, which have been enhanced for supporting add-ons. These APIs are summarized as follows (See [Appendix A](#appendix-a-catalog-20-apis) for the Add-on API reference):

* **GetAllPurchases**: Lists the current (and optionally historical) products and purchase options associated with the Roku customer account. The v2 **GetAllPurchases** command includes a new **includesExpired** flag that enables you to get the historical purchases associated with the customer account. As a result, the **getAllPurchases** command is not used for this integration.

* **GetCatalog**: Retrieves the list of products and purchase options in the app.

* **QueryPuchaseOptions**: Takes the new purchase option map and product map objects returned by the **GetPurchases** and **GetCatalog** commands and returns a list of purchase options matching the specified query. This command helps developers determine which purchase options to offer to customers (it replaces the complex BrightScript mapping login used in earlier versions of this integration).

* **DoOrder**: Displays the Roku Pay order confirmation screen where customers complete their subscription and add-on purchase.

The new versions of these ChannelStore APIs use Roku's generic request framework, which enables developers to pass the ChannelStore command, parameters, and context into a single **request** object (an associative array). The result of the request is encapsulated in a **requestStatus** object (also an associative array), which includes the status of the request and the data returned by it. Channels must observe the **requestStatus** field to be notified of changes and fire a callback function to parse and process the Channel Store API commands.

To update your app with the new Channel Store APIs, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the ChannelStore API generic request framework. The following code monitors the **channelStore.requestStatus** field and fires the **onRequestStatus()** callback function when changes to the **requestStatus** field occur. The **onRequestStatus()** function determines which command was sent and sends the results to the dedicated parser for the command.

   ```brightscript
   function init()
       m.store = m.parent.FindNode("channelStore")
       m.store.observeField("requestStatus", "onRequestStatus")
   end function

   ' Generic SDK API request callback
   function onRequestStatus()
       requestStatus = m.store.requestStatus

       if requestStatus = invalid
           print "Invalid requestStatus"
       else
           print "requestStatus", requestStatus
           print "requestStatus.command", requestStatus.command
           print "requestStatus.status", requestStatus.status
           print "requestStatus.statusMessage", requestStatus.statusMessage
           print "requestStatus.context", requestStatus.context

           ' requestStatus.status:
           ' 2: Interrupted
           ' 1: Success
           ' 0: Network error
           ' -1: HTTP Error/Timeout
           ' -2: Timeout
           ' -3: Unknown error
           ' -4: Invalid request

           ' Generic request succeeded
           if requestStatus.status = 1 then
               if requestStatus.command = "GetCatalog" then
                   onGetCatalog(requestStatus.result)
               else if requestStatus.command = "QueryPurchaseOptions" then
                   onQueryPurchaseOptions(requestStatus.context, requestStatus.result)
               else if requestStatus.command = "DoOrder" then
                   onOrderStatus(requestStatus.result)
               else if requestStatus.command = "GetPurchases" then
                   onGetPurchases(requestStatus.result)
               end if
           end if
       end if
   end function
   ```

2. Send the **GetCatalog** command to get the list of purchase options. In all the requests within the add-on API workflow, the version field must be set to **2**.

   ```brightscript
   sub GetCatalog()
       request = {}
       request.command = "GetCatalog"
       request.params = {
           "version": 2
       }
       m.store.request = request
   end sub
   ```

3. From the **OnGetCatalog()** callback function, store the **purchaseOptionsMap** and **productsMap** collections returned by the **GetCatalog** command.

   ```brightscript
   sub onGetCatalog(requestResult as object)
       print "requestResult.status", requestResult.status
       print "requestResult.statusMessage", requestResult.statusMessage

       m.purchaseOptions = {}
       m.products = {}

       ' GetCatalog succeeded
       if requestResult.status = 1 and type(requestResult.result) = "roAssociativeArray" then
           m.purchaseOptions = requestResult.result.purchaseOptionsMap
           m.products = requestResult.result.productsMap
       end if
   end sub
   ```

4. Use the **QueryPurchaseOptions** command to offer the customer base and bundle purchase options in the UI. The following example creates a map of base and bundle purchase options:

   ```brightscript
   sub queryBasePurchaseOptions()
       query = [
           {"billingType":"Subscription","base":true},
           {"billingType":"Subscription","bundle":true}
       ]
       QueryPurchaseOptions("Base", query)
   end sub

   sub QueryPurchaseOptions(queryType as String, query as Object)
       request = {
           "context": {
               "queryType": queryType
           }
           "params": {
               "purchaseOptionsMap": m.purchaseOptions
               "productsMap": m.products
               "query": query
           }
           "command": "QueryPurchaseOptions"
       }
       m.store.request = request
   end sub

   sub onQueryPurchaseOptions(context as object, requestResult as object)
       if context.queryType = "Base" then
           m.basePurchaseOptions = requestResult.purchaseOptionsMap
           offerBasePurchaseOptions()
       else if context.queryType = "Addon" then
           m.addonPurchaseOptions = requestResult.purchaseOptionsMap
           offerAddonPurchaseOptions()
       end if
   end sub
   ```

5. Offer the customer add-on purchase options in the UI. The following example creates a map of add-on purchase options that are available for the specified SKU of a base purchase option:

   ```brightscript
   sub queryAddonPurchaseOptions()
          query = [
              {"referenceSku":m.base,"addon":true}
          ]
          QueryPurchaseOptions("Addon", query)
      end sub

      sub onQueryPurchaseOptions(context as object, requestResult as object)
          if context.queryType = "Base" then
              m.basePurchaseOptions = requestResult.purchaseOptionsMap
              offerBasePurchaseOptions()
          else if context.queryType = "Addon" then
              m.addonPurchaseOptions = requestResult.purchaseOptionsMap
              offerAddonPurchaseOptions()
          end if
   end sub
   ```

6. Send the **DoOrder** command to purchase the base prerequisite product and any add-ons, and then check the order status.

   ```brightscript
   sub DoOrder()
       request = {}
       request.command = "DoOrder"
       orderItems = []
       if m.content.base <> "" then
           orderItems.push({
               "sku" : m.content.base
               "qty" : 1
           })
       end if
       for each addon in m.content.addons
           orderItems.push({
               "sku" : addon
               "qty" : 1
           })
       end for
       request.params = {
           "version": 2
           "orderItems": orderItems
       }
       m.store.request = request
   end sub
   function onOrderStatus(requestResult as object) as void
       print chr(10) + "onOrderStatus"
       dialog = CreateObject("roSGNode", "statusDialog")
       message = ""
       if requestResult.status <> 1
           message = "status: " + str(requestResult.status) + chr(10)
           message += "statusMessage: " + requestResult.statusMessage
       else
           message = "Your Purchase completed successfully" + chr(10)
           message += "statusMessage: " + requestResult.statusMessage + chr(10)
           if type(requestResult.result) = "roAssociativeArray" then
               purchases = requestResult.result.purchases
               ' roArray
               if type(purchases) = "roArray" then
                   for i = 0 to purchases.Count() - 1
                       message += chr(10) + "Product " + AnyToString(i+1) + ":" + chr(10)
                       item = purchases[i]
                       ' roAssociativeArray
                       print type(item)
                       print "item", item
                       if item.replacedPurchase <> invalid then
                           print "item.replacedPurchase", item.replacedPurchase
                       end if
                       keys = item.Keys()
                       for each key in keys
                           strField = AnyToString(item[key])
                           if strField <> invalid
                               if strField.len() > 0
                                   message += key + " = " + strField + chr(10)
                               else
                                   message += key + " = " + chr(10)
                               end if
                           else
                               message += key + " = " + chr(10)
                           end if
                       end for
                   end for
               end if
           end if
       end if
       print "message", message
       dialog.message = message
       m.top.getScene().dialog = dialog
   end function
   ```

7. Send the **GetAllPurchases** command to query the customer's purchases, and then check the order status. The response includes three arrays: **purchases**, **products**, and **entitlements**. If a cross-partner bundle subscription was purchased, its information is in the **entitlements** list.

   ```brightscript
   sub GetAllPurchases()
       request = {}
       request.command = "GetPurchases"
       request.params = {
           "version": 2,
           "includeExpired": true
       }
       m.store.request = request
   end sub

   function onGetAllPurchases(requestResult as object) as void
       m.purchases = {}
       m.purchasedProducts = {}
       m.entitlements = []

       print chr(10) + "onGetAllPurchases"
       dialog = CreateObject("roSGNode", "statusDialog")
       message = ""
       if requestResult.status <> 1
           message = "status: " + str(requestResult.status) + chr(10)
           message += "statusMessage: " + requestResult.statusMessage
       else
           purchaseResult = requestResult.result
           ' AA
           print chr(10) + "purchaseResult", type(purchaseResult)
           if type(purchaseResult) <> "roAssociativeArray" or purchaseResult.purchases = invalid then
               print chr(10) + "invalid purchaseResult.purchases"

## Sample app

The [add-ons sample app](https://github.com/rokudev/samples/tree/master/roku%20pay/add-ons) demonstrates how to integrate add-ons and bundles in your app to offer customers premium content, additional channels, bundled packages, and other upgrades and features. It lets you purchase base subscription products and bundles in your product catalog, and then purchase any eligible add-ons.

## Appendix A: Catalog 2.0 APIs

The **requestStatus** object returned by the ChannelStore generic request framework is an **roAssociativeArray** that has the following hierarchy. Observe that the products, purchase options, and entitlements returned by the ChannelStore commands are encapsulated in a nested **result.result** associative array.

```
"requestStatus": {
    "command": "GetCatalog",
    "status": 2,
    "statusMessage": "...",
    "context": {...},
    "result": {
        "status": 2,
        "statusMessage": "...",
        "result": {
            "products": [...],
            "purchaseOptions": [...],
            "entitlements": [...]
        }
    }
}
```

## Appendix B: Roku Pay Web Services updates

The new catalog data structure has not changed any of the Roku Pay web service API contracts. The fields returned by the Roku Pay APIs remain the same. The only change is that the values included in the **productId** and **productName** fields now reference the **purchase option** associated with the transaction, instead of the **product**.

> Publishers should map the values returned in the **productName** and **productId** fields, which reference the purchase option, to the associated products in their backend system

## Appendix C: On-device add-on purchase workflow

When the **DoOrder** command is sent, the Roku Pay order confirmation screen lists each product being purchased, including base subscriptions and add-ons.

![img - roku600px](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/two-items.jpg)

If the purchase includes two or more add-ons, the customer can press the PLAY button on their Roku remote control to view an itemized list of products before confirming the purchase.

## Appendix D: Base subscription and add-on management workflow for customers

Customers can cancel their base subscriptions and add-ons either directly on-device or online from Roku's Subscription management page.

At least one base prerequisite product must be active in order for an add-on product to remain active as well. If no base prerequisite products are active, the add-on product is cancelled. For example, if the customer cancels the prerequisite base product (and is not entitled to any other prerequisites), the add-on is also canceled.

If a customer upgrades/downgrades a base prerequisite subscription product, the add-on remains active only if the upgrade/downgrade transaction includes a different prerequisite base product and that same add-on. For example, customers can sign up for one base prerequisite and an add-on, and then upgrade to a second base prerequisite product (the upgrade transaction must include the new base product and the same add-on), and then downgrade back to the first (the downgrade transaction must include the new base product and the same add-on), without access to the add-on being interrupted.

When an add-on is canceled, its entitlement is removed from the Roku customer account at the next billing cycle (no refunds are given for partial-term cancellations)

> When a customer upgrades/downgrades their base subscription product and retains one or more add-ons linked to that base product, you must include those retained add-ons in the **DoOrder** request.

#### On-device subscription management workflow

The following images demonstrate how the on-device add-on management and cancelation workflow can be used to cancel base subscription products and add-ons:
