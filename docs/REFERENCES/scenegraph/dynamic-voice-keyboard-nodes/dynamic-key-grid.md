Extends [**Group**](doc:group)

The **DynamicKeyGrid** node implements a grid of keys that are defined and organized in a [Key Definition File](doc:key-definition-file). It is typically used in a subclass of the [DynamicKeyboardBase](doc:dynamic-keyboard-base) node (DynamicKeyboard, DynamicPinPad, and DynamicMiniKeyboard) to display the string of characters entered via text or voice entry. It may also be used as an individual node.
