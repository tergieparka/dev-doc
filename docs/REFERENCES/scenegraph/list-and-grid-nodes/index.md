Lists and grids are important screen elements for the application user
interface. Lists and grids allow the user to choose from a selection of
items that, for example, can include the title of movie to rent or
purchase, and a graphic image of theater poster for the movie. The
SceneGraph API allows you to include several data items for each item in
the list or grid, such as the price to rent or buy the movie, and to
display this information to the user when the user selects the item.

## List and grid nodes

The following are the list and grid node classes supplied by Roku as
part of the SceneGraph API:

  - [LabelList](doc:labellist)
  - [MarkupList](doc:markuplist)
  - [PosterGrid](doc:postergrid)
  - [MarkupGrid](doc:markupgrid)
  - [RowList](doc:rowlist)
  - [CheckList](doc:checklist)
  - [RadioButtonList](doc:radiobuttonlist)
  - [TargetList](doc:targetlist)
  - [TargetSet](doc:targetset)
  - [ZoomRowList](doc:zoomrowlist)
  - [TimeGrid](doc:timegrid)

These list and grid node classes are derived from the abstract base
class **[ArrayGrid](doc:arraygrid)**. Most of the fields
described in the reference information for each list or grid node
class are described in the **ArrayGrid** reference information, though
sometimes with slightly different field names.

## Lists and grids

Lists are a single column of items arranged vertically. Grids are
multiple columns of items arranged both vertically (for the items in the
column), and horizontally (for the rows of items across the columns).

Items are indexed by list and grid nodes based on their position in the
[**ContentNode**](doc:contentnode) node that
defines each item in the list or grid (see [**Specifying List and
Grid Content**](doc:overview)).
The first item defined in the **ContentNode** node is assigned index 0,
the second item is assigned index 1, and so forth. The **ContentNode**
node index determines the position of the item in the list or grid,
depending on how you define the list or grid.

For lists, the index starts at 0 for the item at the top of the list,
and increments for each item lower in the
list:

For grids, the index starts at 0 for the item at the top left corner of
the grid, and increments for each item to the right in the grid row, and
when the end of a row is reached, increments for the left-most item in
the next lower row, and continues incrementing from left to right and
top to bottom for each row in the grid. For example, if you specified a
3-column grid (by setting the `numColumns` field to `3` as described in
[**List and Grid Layout
Options**](doc:overview)), the index
would increment as
follows:

SceneGraph also provides another type of list/grid node class,
**RowList**, that combines aspects of both lists and grids. See
[**RowList Node
Class**](doc:overview) for information
about this hybrid node class.

## Item focus and selection

Automatic remote control focus and selection of items by the user is
provided by list and grid nodes. When a list or grid has remote control
focus, a specific item in the list or grid has focus at any time. A list
or grid node automatically responds to remote control direction pad
**Up** and
**Down** key presses for
lists, and **Up**,
**Down**,
**Right**, and
**Left** key presses for
grids, by moving focus to the next item in that direction in the list or
grid. When an item is focused, the user can select the item by pressing
the **OK** key. Read-only
fields are provided by the list or grid node class to indicate the index
number of the item that is focused, unfocused after being focused, or
selected at any time, allowing an application response to these user
actions in the list or grid. The read-only list or grid fields that
provide this information
are: 

| Read-Only Field | Changed Value Indication                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `itemFocused`   | The list or grid item is currently focused by the user.                                                                               |
| `itemUnfocused` | The list or grid item was focused by the user, but the user moved the focus to another item.                                          |
| `itemSelected`  | The list or grid item was selected by the user by pressing the remote control **OK** key. |

You can use the `ObserveField()` interface function for the list or grid
node to trigger a callback function in response to changes in these
fields. For example, the following calls a `displayepisodeinfo()`
function that could provide additional information to the user as
the focus moves to an item in a list of TV program episodes:

` m.episodelist.ObserveField("itemFocused","displayepisodeinfo")`

Likewise, if the user selects the item by pressing the remote control
**OK** key, you can write a
`playepisode()` callback function triggered by the `itemSelected` field
event to begin playback of the selected episode:

`m.episodelist.ObserveField("itemSelected","playepisode")`

Since the index number for each item is the position of each child item
in the **ContentNode** node that defines the list or grid, you can use
them to retrieve data from the child **ContentNode** node associated
with the item (or also from parallel arrays you have created for this
purpose). This allows you retrieve the data needed to write the callback
functions that are triggered by the list or grid item field changes. For
example, the following accesses TV episode data in the **ContentNode**
node for a list using the `getChild()` interface function taking the
`itemFocused` field value as the argument, as part of a callback
function to display TV episode information for the focused episode list
item:

`episodeinfo =
m.episodelist.content.getChild(m.episodelist.itemFocused)`

The list or grid node class also provides options for automatically
indicating to the user that focus is on an item. The item can have a
different color, or a bitmap drawn on the item, to indicate focus. The
list or grid node class includes default 9-patch PNG bitmaps that
surround the selected item, as well as an automatic text color change
for lists of label items, but you can also customize these focus
indicators for your design. The fields used to customize these options
are:

| Focus Option Field        | Use                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `drawFocusFeedback`       | Specify whether the focus graphic image is drawn on a focused item or not                          |
| `drawFocusFeedbackOnTop`  | Specify whether the focus graphic image is drawn on top or underneath the focused item             |
| `focusBitmapUri`          | Specify a custom graphic image to be drawn on the item to indicate focus                           |
| `focusFootprintBitmapUri` | Specify a custom graphic image for a focused item when the list does not have currently have focus |
| `focusedColor`            | Sets the text color of the focused list item, for **LabelList** nodes only                         |
| `focusedFont`             | Sets the font of the focused list item, for **LabelList** nodes only                               |

If you want a custom focus indicator that cannot be defined using these
fields, you should use one of the node classes described in
[**Custom Item Definitions and Focus
Indicators**](doc:overview).

## Specifying list and grid content

The items included, and some of their display configuration, for a list
or grid node class is specified by setting a **ContentNode** node as the
value of the `content` field of the list or grid node. The parameters of
each item in a list or grid is specified as a child **ContentNode** node
of the **ContentNode** node specified in the `content` field.

The easiest way to do this is by reading the content data from an XML or
JSON file, either from an application package file or a file downloaded
from your server. Then use the BrightScript or the BrightScript
component parsing functions to parse the data in a loop that creates the
**ContentNode** node and child **ContentNode** nodes, and assign the
resulting **ContentNode** to the `content` field of the list or grid.
For examples, see:

  - [**ContentNode
    Description**](doc:contentnode) for
    the general procedure using the **roSGNode** interface functions
  - [**Task Example**](doc:task) for a specific
    code example of configuring a **ContentNode** node for a
    **LabelList** node using a **Task** node
  - [**Downloading Server
    Content**](doc:downloading-server-content) also shows the
    server (or application package) XML file for the same example, and
    how the **ContentNode** node is assigned to the **LabelList** node
  - [**ContentNode
    Example**](doc:contentnode) also shows
    how to manually set up a **ContentNode** node for a **LabelList**
    node in BrightScript

## List and grid layout options

You have many options for arranging and displaying the items in a list
or grid. Specific options depend on the type of list or grid you want to
display.

For all lists and grids, you can specify a default size of the items in
the list or grid. You can also specify the default spacing between each
item in the list or grid. But you can also override the default size and
spacing of items that you have set with individual sizes and spacings
for each item in the list or grid. The fields to control these options
are:

  - `itemSize` or `basePosterSize` (for list or grid items that are
    posters)
  - `rowHeights`
  - `columnWidths`
  - `itemSpacing`
  - `rowSpacings`
  - `columnSpacings`

For all lists and grids, you can specify the number of visible item rows
for the list or grid by setting the `numRows` field, but the actual
number of rows will always depend on the number of items in the list or
grid, as specified by the **ContentNode** node set as the value of the
`content` field for the list or grid node. For grids, you can specify
the number of item columns, by setting the `numColumns` field. 

Lists and grids can also be divided into sections, and each section can
have an icon, a label, and other customizable elements to visually
divide the list or grid sections. The list or grid node class includes
default section divider bitmaps. To divide your list or grid into
sections, you must create a child **ContentNode** node for each section
in your **ContentNode** node specified in the `content` field, that
includes the child **ContentNode** nodes for each list or grid item in
the section.

The fields to set the appearance of section dividers are:

  - `sectionDividerFont`
  - `sectionDividerTextColor`
  - `sectionDividerBitmapUri`
  - `sectionDividerSpacing`
  - `sectionDividerWidth`
  - `sectionDividerHeight`
  - `sectionDividerMinWidth`
  - `sectionDividerLeftOffset`

## Wrapping, fixed, and floating focus

In addition, you have two options for how the list or grid operates as
the user presses the direction pad keys. You can have a list or grid
with the items or grid rows scroll into a fixed focus area as the
**Up** and
**Down** direction keys are
pressed. When the user reaches the last or first item or grid row, the
list or grid wraps back to the first or last item or grid row. Or you
can have the focus move up, down, left, and right in the list or grid.
The fields to set these options are:

  - `horizFocusAnimationStyle`
  - `vertFocusAnimationStyle`

If the list or grid is set to wrap when the first or last item is
reached, the list or grid node provides a default visual divider element
between the first and last items that can be customized. The fields used
to customize the wrap divider element are:

  - `wrapDividerBitmapUri`
  - `wrapDividerWidth`
  - `wrapDividerHeight`

## Custom item definitions and focus indicators

The
[**RowList**](doc:rowlist),
[**MarkupList**](doc:markuplist), and
[**MarkupGrid**](doc:markupgrid) node classes provide the
ultimate flexibility to present lists and grids with fully-customized
item appearance and focus indicators. These node classes allow you to
create a custom component for list or grid items to define whatever
appearance and behavior you want for your application. If you want to
have several posters with multiple labels in each list or grid item, and
animate them to appear and disappear as the item is focused and
unfocused, you'll want to use these customizable list/grid node
classes.

The key to customizing these
node classes is to create custom item definitions in a component XML
file. You define all the screen elements you need for your custom
list and grid items in this item component file, such as posters, labels,
rectangles, and so forth. Then you can create custom appearance and
behavior for the items by writing callback functions triggered by
`onChange` events in the **\<interface\>** element fields you select for
the item. These customizable list/grid node classes provide a much
greater selection of built-in **\<interface\>** element fields than
those provided by the standard list/grid node classes. These additional
fields allow you program custom appearance and behavior of the item,
such as custom animations when the user focuses/selects the items.

The additional
read-only **\<interface\>** element fields for item components in these
customizable lists and grids are:

  - `width`
  - `height`
  - `index`
  - `focusPercent`
  - `listHasFocus` (**MarkupList** node class only)
  - `gridHasFocus` (**MarkupGrid** node class only)

When the list or grid is created, an
instance of the item component is created for each item node definition
included in the **ContentNode** node for the list or grid. Each one of
these item instances can then respond according to the scripts included
in the item component file as user or other program events occur, by
triggering callback functions in the item component.

### RowList node class

The **RowList** node class is a
special list/grid node class that mixes aspects of both lists and grids.
A **RowList** node component consists of a set of one or more rows of
items, each of which, when focused, scrolls horizontally as the user
presses the **Right** or
**Left** keys to focus on
items in the row. Items in other rows in the list do not scroll along
with the focused row as they would for a grid. To focus on another row,
the user presses the **Up**
and **Down** keys to select
the row, as they would to focus on items in a list.

The **RowList** node class has
additional fields for the row focused/selected, the entire **RowList**
node focused, the item focused/selected in a row, and a 2-element array
field type indicating the selected item in a focused row. The additional
read-only fields are:

  - `rowIndex`
  - `rowFocusPercent`
  - `rowHasFocus`
  - `rowListHasFocus`

The additional read-only 2-element
fields containing the item focused/selected are:

  - `rowItemFocused`
  - `rowItemSelected`

The first element of these field
arrays contain the index of the focused/selected row; the second element
contains the index of the focused/selected item in the focused row.

### Custom focus indicators

The **RowList**, **MarkupList**, and
**MarkupGrid** node classes provide special **\<interface\>** fields for
item component definitions that enable animations to indicate focus
changes to the user. The `focusPercent` field can be used with an
`onChange` attribute callback function to animate focus indicators as
focus moves from item to item. The `focusPercent` field is the
fractional value, from 0.0 to 1.0, of a time delay after focus has moved
from one item to the next. The fractional value increases incrementally
from 0.0 to 1.0 for the newly-focused item, while simultaneously
decreasing from 1.0 to 0.0 for the previously-focused item. For example,
to enlarge a poster slightly when the item receives focus, while
simultaneously shrinking the poster of the previously focused item, you
could set up an **\<interface\>** element
`focusPercent` field  `onChange` callback function `showfocus()` in
the item component XML file:

`<interface>`  
`  ...`  
`  <field id="focusPercent" type="float" onChange="showfocus" /> `

`  ...`  
`</interface>`

`<script>``  <![CDATA[  ...  ``sub showfocus()     scale = 1 +
(m.top.focusPercent * 0.08)     m.itemposter.scale = [scale, scale]  
end sub...`

The **RowList** node class also
includes the `rowFocusPercent` field to allow animating a focus
indicator when the user focuses on an item in an adjacent row, either
above or below the previously-focused row.

## Optimizing the rendering performance of lists and grids

There are two advanced methods to
optimize the rendering speed of complex lists and grids.

## Optimizing lists and grids with multiple item sub-elements

Lists and grid items can contain
several sub-elements (such as rental/purchase prices, MPAA rating icons,
and so forth) that can be drawn on top of or adjacent to the item. The
default method of drawing list or grid items is to render all of the
items and any sub-elements in one rendering operation. For complex lists
or grids with several sub-elements drawn for each item, this default
method may render the list or grid slowly. To increase the performance
of rendering complex lists and grids, there is a special field in list
and grid nodes, `numRenderPasses`, that controls the rendering of the
list or grid items in conjunction with the `renderPass` field of the
item sub-elements.

If you decide to optimize the performance of complex lists and grids, you must set up a sequence of
rendering of the list or grid item sub-elements, so all the sub-elements
for the items render in sequential order rather than in one rendering
operation. To do this, decide which sub-elements to render in which
order of a sequence of rendering operations. For example, the main
poster for an grid item may have a label and a smaller poster drawn on
top of it. You can specify that the main poster will render first, the
label second, and the smaller poster third, by setting the `renderPass`
field value for each of these sub-elements to 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
Then you set the grid `numRenderPasses` field value to 3, the total
number of rendering operations for the grid.

Be very careful when setting the list or grid `numRenderPasses` and the
item sub-element `renderPass` field values. If you set the
`numRenderPasses` field to a value greater than 1, any list or grid item
sub-element `renderPass` field value that is set to 0 (the default), or
to a value greater than the `numRenderPasses` field value, will not
render.

### Optimizing grids with different sized or large poster items

You can optimize the rendering speed of grids that have poster items of
several different sizes, or are very large, by setting the
grid `useAtlas` field value to false. The field value toggles the use
of a texture atlas that stores the posters in the grid. The default is
`true`, since in many cases, most of the posters in the grid have the
same size as determined by the grid `basePosterSize` field value. In
this case, using the texture atlas can provide a rendering performance
benefit. For grids that have more complicated layouts, that include
several posters that have sizes that differ from the value of
`basePosterSize`, or for grids where there are only a few large posters
(about five to eight, or posters that are about a quarter of the screen
height or width) displayed at the same time, setting this field to
`false` may provide faster rendering speed of the grid.
