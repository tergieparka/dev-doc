Extends [**Node**](doc:node)

Group is the base class of all renderable nodes. Group also provides fields that control the transformation, visibility and opacity of themselves and all of their children.

Each Group defines a local coordinate system relative to the coordinate system of its parent node. A 2D matrix that describes how points in the local coordinate system can be transformed into the parent node coordinate system is constructed from the values of the translation, rotation, scale, and scaleRotateCenter fields.

The 2D matrix is computed using the values of these four fields in the following order:

* translating by the negative of the scaleRotateCenter field value
* scaling by the scale field value
* rotating by the rotation field value
* translating by the scaleRotateCenter field value
* translating by the translation field value

In matrix math terms, the overall 2D matrix is:

M = C(-1) S R C T

Where:

* M is the total matrix
* C is a 2D translation matrix that describes the location of the scale/rotation center in the node's local coordinate system
* C(-1) is the inverse of C
* S is a 2D scaling matrix
* R is a 2D rotation matrix
* T is a 2D translation matrix

> In nearly all cases, either the default values for these four fields will be used (in which case, the local coordinate system of the node is the same as the parent node coordinate system), or only a translation will be specified (in which, the local coordinate system is a simple offset from the parent node coordinate system).

      <td>Sets the opacity of the node and its children. Opacity is the opposite of transparency. Opacity values range from 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). As the SceneGraph is traversed, the opacity values are combined by multiplying the current accumulated opacity with the node opacity, so that if the accumulated opacity of a node ancestors is 0.25 (75% transparent), the node will have opacity of 0.25 or less. This allows entire branches of the SceneGraph to fade in and out by animating the opacity of the node at the root of the branch</td>
