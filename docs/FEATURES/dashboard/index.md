The [Developer Dashboard](http://developer.roku.com/dev/dashboard) serves as the central control center from which a developer can manage apps, Roku Pay products, or search feeds, as well as view analytics and enroll in the partner payouts program.

## My apps

The **My apps** section provides easy access to recently updated apps, enabling developers to quickly click into their most high-touch projects.

Clicking on any of these apps will take the user to the Preview & Publish page for the app, from which they can edit the app metadata. Refer to [App publishing](doc:channel-publishing-guide) for information on managing app settings.

## Scheduled releases

The **Scheduled releases** section of the main panel lists app releases, product updates, or offers that were previously scheduled by the developer, ordered by date.

# Additional topics

In addition to the utilities found on the Developer Dashboard itself, developers can also navigate to several additional tools from the left-hand navigation menu of the Developer Dashboard.

### Channel

The app section allows developers to manage their apps, Streaming Store listings, and Roku Search feed configurations.

* **My apps –** This is where developers can create new apps or update existing apps. Here, developers can configure an app's settings, Streaming Store metadata listing, or update new application packages. Read the documentation on [App publishing](doc:channel-publishing-guide) for information.
* **Search feeds –** The search feed validator allows developers to submit a search feed URL to Roku, in order to begin the process of integrating their apps into Roku Search. Read the documentation on [Implementing Roku Search](doc:implementing-search) for more information.

### Monetization

* **Test users –** Here, developers can manage any Roku accounts that should have "test user" permissions for their apps, meaning these users will not be charged for any products they purchase within the designated app using Roku Pay. A valid payment method is required but purchases will not be charged. Read the documentation on [Creating test users](doc:test-users) for more information.
