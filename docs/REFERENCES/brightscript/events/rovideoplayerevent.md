The roVideoPlayer sends the roVideoPlayerEvent with the following predicates that indicate its valid event types:

## Supported methods

### isPaused() as Boolean

Checks whether video playback was paused by the user. This method returns true if video playback was paused; otherwise, it returns false.

  }
  screen.SetContent(episode)
  screen.SetMessagePort(port)
  screen.Show()
  while true
    msg = wait(0, port)
    if type(msg) = "roVideoScreenEvent" then
      if msg.isCaptionModeChanged()
