## Implemented by

| Name         | Description                                                           |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|[roUrlTransfer](doc:rourltransfer) | A roUrlTransfer object transfers data to or from remote servers specified by URLs. It can perform mutual authentication with a web server |


## Supported methods

> Each roUrlTransfer object can perform only one asynchronous operation at one time. After starting an asynchronous operation, you cannot perform any other data transfer operations using that object until the asynchronous operation has completed, as indicated by receiving an roUrlEvent message whose GetSourceIdentity value matches the GetIdentity value of the roUrlTransfer.
>
> Furthermore, the roUrlTransfer object must remain referenced until the transfer has completed. That means that there must be at least one variable containing a reference to the object during the transfer.  Allowing the variable to go out of scope (for example, by returning from a function where the variable is declared, or reusing the variable to hold a different value) will stop the asynchronous transfer.

### GetIdentity() as Integer

#### Description

Returns a unique number for this object that can be used to identify whether events originated from this object. The value can be any arbitrary value as assigned by the Roku OS, and should only be used for comparison purposes. For example, the value should not be used as an array index. For use as a look-up key, one option would be to use `GetIdentity().ToStr()` as an associative array key.

#### Return Value

A unique number for the object.

#### Example

```brightscript
function Setup()
    m.pendingXfers = {}
end function

function GetAsync(url as String)
    newXfer = CreateObject("roUrlTransfer")
    newXfer.SetUrl(url)
    newXfer.AsyncGetToString()
    requestId = newXfer.GetIdentity().ToStr()
    m.pendingXfers[requestId] = newXfer
end function

function HandleUrlEvent(event as Object)
    requestId = event.GetSourceIdentity().ToStr()
    xfer = m.pendingXfers[requestId]
    if xfer <> invalid then
        ' process it
        m.pendingXfers.Delete(requestId)
    end if
end function
```

### SetUrl(url as String) as Void

#### Description

Sets the URL to use for the transfer request.

#### Parameters

| Name  | Type   | Description |
| ----- | -----  | -------------- |
| url   | String | The URL to be used for the transfer request |

### GetUrl() as String

#### Description

Returns the current URL.

#### Return Value

The URL.

### SetRequest(req as String)

#### Description

Changes the request method from the normal GET, HEAD or POST to the value passed as a string.

>  Use this function cautiously because it can generate invalid HTTP requests.

#### Parameters

| Name  | Type    | Description |
| ----  | ------- | -------------- |
| req   | String  | The request method to be used |

### GetRequest() as String

#### Description

Returns the current request method.

#### Return Value

The request method.

### GetToString() as String

#### Description

Connects to the remote service as specified in the URL and returns the response body as a string. This function waits for the transfer to complete and it may block for a long time. This calls discards the headers and response codes. If that information is required, use the [AsyncGetToString()](#asyncgettostring-as-boolean) method.

#### Return Value

The response body.

### GetToFile(filename as String) as Integer

#### Description

Connect to the remote service as specified in the URL and write the response body to a file on the Roku device's filesystem. This function does not return until the exchange is complete and may block for a long time. The HTTP response code from the server is returned. It is not possible to access any of the response headers. If this information is required use the [AsyncGetToFile()](#asyncgettofilefilename-as-string-as-boolean) method instead.

#### Parameters

| Name     | Type    | Description |
| ----     | ------- | -------------- |
| filename | String  | The file on the Roku device's filesystem to which the response body is to be written |

#### Return Value

The HTTP response code.

### AsyncGetToString() as Boolean

#### Description

Starts a GET request to a server, but does not wait for the transfer to complete.

When the GET request completes, a [roUrlEvent](doc:rourlevent) will be sent to the message port associated with the object. The event will contain a roString with the body of the response. If false is returned then the request could not be issued and no events will be delivered.

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the request was issued.

### AsyncGetToFile(filename as String) as Boolean

#### Description

Starts a transfer without waiting for it to complete, similar to the [AsyncGetToString()](#asyncgettostring-as-boolean) method. However, the response body will be written to a file on the device's filesystem instead of being returned in a String object.

When the GET request completes, an [roUrlEvent](doc:rourlevent) will be sent to the message port associated with the object. If false is returned then the request could not be issued and no events will be delivered.

| Name  | Type    | Description |
| ----  | ------- | -------------- |
| filename | String  | The file on the Roku device's filesystem to which the response body is to be written |

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the request was issued.

### Head() as Dynamic

#### Description

Synchronously performs an HTTP HEAD request and returns an [roUrlTransfer](doc:ifurltransfer) object.

#### Return Value

An [roUrlTransfer](doc:ifurltransfer) object.  If a catastrophic failure occurs (for example, an asynchronous operation is already active), invalid is returned

### AsyncHead() as Boolean

#### Description

Begins an HTTP HEAD request without waiting for it to complete. When the HEAD completes, an [roUrlEvent](doc:rourlevent) will be sent to the message port associated with the object. If false is returned then the request could not be issued and no events will be delivered.

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the request was issued.

### PostFromString(request as String) as Integer

#### Description

Uses the HTTP POST method to send the supplied string to the current URL. The HTTP response code is returned. Any response body is discarded

#### Parameters

| Name  | Type    | Description |
| ----  | ------- | -------------- |
| request | String  | The POST request to be sent |

#### Return Value

The HTTP response code.

### PostFromFile(filename as String) as Integer

#### Description

Uses the HTTP POST method to send the contents of the specified file to the current URL. The HTTP response code is returned. Any response body is discarded

#### Parameters

| Name  | Type    | Description |
| ----  | ------- | -------------- |
| filename | String  | The file containing the POST request to be sent |

#### Return Value

The HTTP response code.

### AsyncPostFromString(request as String) as Boolean

#### Description

Uses the HTTP POST method to send the supplied string to the current URL. When the POST request completes, an [roUrlTransfer](doc:ifurltransfer) will be sent to the message port associated with the object. If false is returned then the request could not be issued and no events will be delivered.

#### Parameters

| Name  | Type    | Description |
| ----  | ------- | -------------- |
| request | String  | The POST request to be sent asynchronously|

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the request was issued.

### AsyncPostFromFile(filename as String) as Boolean

#### Description

Uses the HTTP POST method to send the contents of the specified file to the current URL. When the POST request completes, an [roUrlTransfer](doc:ifurltransfer) will be sent to the message port associated with the object. If false is returned then the request could not be issued and no events will be delivered.

#### Parameters

| Name     | Type    | Description |
| ----     | ------- | -------------- |
| filename | String  | The file containing the POST request to be sent asynchronously|

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the request was issued.

### AsyncPostFromFileToFile(fromFile as String, toFile as String) as Boolean

#### Description

Uses the HTTP POST method to send the contents of the specified file (fromFile) to the current URL. When the POST request completes successfully, an [roUrlTransfer](doc:ifurltransfer) will be sent to the message port associated with the object. If false is returned then the request could not be issued and no events will be delivered.  This function is the same as AsyncPostFromFile, except that the HTTP response is written to the file specified by the toFile parameter.

#### Parameters
