Extends [**Node**](doc:node)

The SoundEffect node class is used to play audio sound effects that can be triggered from events that occur in the UI. Typically, these sound effects are short audio clips, but there is no inherent limit on their length. Currently, up to four simultaneous sounds can be playing at any time, in addition to audio from streaming content and TextToSpeech audio.

Files can be installed locally as part of the package file or dynamically downloaded from the network. All files must be WAV (i.e. PCM) format.

For local files, the convention is to include the WAV files in a directory named "sounds".

For downloaded files, a least-recently-used (LRU) mechanism is used to keep the most recently downloaded/played sounds in temporary storage on the device. If the limits on the maximum number/size of downloaded sounds is exceeded, the least recently used sounds are removed from temporary storage. They will be automatically reloaded the next time the control field is set to "play".

A sample demonstrating how to use the SoundEffect node can be found here: [SimpleSoundEffect](https://github.com/rokudev/samples/blob/master/media/SimpleSoundEffect)
