Extends [StandardDialog](doc:standard-dialog)

The **StandardKeyboardDialog** node enables text and voice entry of strings consisting of alphanumeric characters as well as many commonly used symbols. It is similar to the legacy [KeyboardDialog](doc:keyboarddialog) node, but includes voice entry functionality, which is provided through its internal **DynamicKeyboard** node.
