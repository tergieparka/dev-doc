OTT providers can use the TimeGrid node to implement an Electronic Program Guide (EPG) in their apps. In an EPG, channels are represented as horizontal rows, one for each channel. Each row has an channel name on the left, and a set of programs airing on that app to the right. The size of each program depends on its duration. One of these programs has a remote control focus highlight indicator on it, and this highlight can be moved around using the remote control (as long as the TimeGrid node has remote control focus).

The TimeGrid node also features an alternative Now/Next view that lists only the programs currently airing and airing next, with their respective start times. See [Now/Next mode](#nownext-mode) for more information.

## Fields

### Content

The TimeGrid node has a **content **field that can be used to store the information for  and programs displayed in the grid. This **content** field should have a single ContentNode that has one child ContentNode per app, and each app ContentNode should have one child ContentNode for each program, sorted by start time in ascending order (earliest programs first).

> For any program in any channel, the start time plus the duration of any program must be less than or equal to the start time of the next program.

## Measuring EPG launch times

Apps with an EPG must fire signal beacons to measure the EPG launch time. Beacons must be fired when the user initiates a keypress to display the EPG (**EPGLaunchInitiate**) and when the EPG is fully rendered and navigable (**EPGLaunchComplete**). See [Measuring Channel Performance](doc:measuring-channel-performance) for more information.

## Sample app

You can download and install a [sample app](https://github.com/rokudev/SceneGraphDeveloperExtensions/tree/master/samples/TimeGridView) that demonstrates how to use the TimeGridView in the SceneGraph Developer Extensions (SGDEX) to create an EPG. This sample app uses a row-by-row loading model. In this model, a handler config running on the root node of a content tree creates a child node for each row in the EPG. Each of the row child nodes has a handler that creates a child node for each program that should be displayed on that row.
