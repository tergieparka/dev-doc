You can use the [**Roles and access** page in the Roku Launchpad](https://developer.roku.com/account/user-access-list) to enable team members to manage your account or specific apps within it. A **_role_** gives a user a set of one or more **_permissions_** to complete specific tasks in your account. Each role has an **_access level_**, which determines whether the user can complete tasks for all the apps in your account or just one or more selected apps.

For example, the _app management_ role lets users manage and publish one or more apps, the _financial reports_ role lets users view transaction and sales activity reports for one or more apps in the account, and the _administrative_ role lets users complete all tasks in the account.

## Adding users

To add a user to your account and assign them roles and permissions, follow these steps:

1. From the Roku Developer or Roku Content Partner Dashboard, click **User access** on the left sidebar; or from the Roku Launchpad, click **Roles and access**.

2. Click **Invite a user**.

   ![roku600px - multi-user-access-2-roles-access](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/multi-user-access-2-invite-user-button.png)

3. In the **Invite a user** page, enter the following information: <a id="user-roles"></a>
   <HTMLBlock>{`
   <table>
   <thead>
   <tr>
   <th class="short-line"><strong>Field</strong></th>
   <th class="short-line"><strong>Description</strong></th>
   </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
   <tr>
   <td class="short-line">Email</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>

4. Click **Invite**.

5. If the user already has a Roku account, they are immediately granted access to your account with their specified role.

   If the user does not have a Roku account, they receive an email notification from Roku informing them that they have been granted access to your account.

   ![roku600px - mua\_app\_mgmt](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/roku-user-access-invite.png)

   Once the user clicks the accept invite link in the email, they are taken to the Roku Launchpad, where they accept the invite and then select your account. The user can access your account and take actions permitted by their specified role.

## Managing user accounts

You can use the **Roles and access** page to edit, re-invite, and remove users and view their activity logs.

The page lists the email, name, and organization of each user who has been invited to your account, their roles, and their current status.

You can search the listed user accounts by email address or user name.

![roku815px - multi-user-access-2-roles-access](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/multi-user-access-2-activity-logs-search.png)

### Editing users

You can edit the organization and roles of existing users. To edit a user, click anywhere in the user’s row, update the properties, and then click **Save**.

### Re-sending users invites

If you have the Admin role (or are the root account owner), you can re-send an invite to a user. To do this, click the menu icon on the right-hand side of the user’s row, and then click **Resend invite** in the shortcut menu.

### Removing users

If you have the Admin role (or are the root account owner), you can remove a user from the account. To do this, click the menu icon on the right-hand side of the user’s row, click **Remove user** in the shortcut menu, and then click **Yes** in the confirmation dialog.

![roku600px - multi-user-access-2-roles-access](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/multi-user-access-2-remove-user.png)

Removing a user does not affect the user's own Roku account. If you need to add the removed user in the future, you must re-invite them.

## Viewing user activity logs

If you have the Admin role (or are the root account owner), you can access the user activity log, which tracks the actions taken by each user in the account.

The log lists the user’s email address, page they accessed, action taken, subject app, and the date and time of the action.

You can search log entries by email address, page name, action, or app name, and you can sort the entries by clicking the **Email**, **Page**, and **Channel**, and **Date** headers.

![roku815px - multi-user-access-2-roles-access](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/multi-user-access-2-activity-logs-page.png)

- To view the activity log for all users, click **Activity logs** at the top of the page.

  ![roku600px - multi-user-access-2-roles-access](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/multi-user-access-2-activity-logs-link-v2.png)
- To view the activity log for a specific user, click the menu icon on the right-hand side of the user’s row, and then click **View user activity** in the shortcut menu.

## Switching accounts

If you have been granted access to another account, you can change the account you are currently managing. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Switch account** option from the left sidebar.

   ![roku600px - multi-user-access-2-roles-access](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/multi-user-access-2-switch-account.png)
