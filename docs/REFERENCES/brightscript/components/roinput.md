An roInput object can be used to receive events sent from a network client using the External Control Protocol (ECP), as described in [External Control API](doc:external-control-api).

> The [supports_input_launch manifest flag](doc:channel-manifest) must be set for channels to accept deep linking parameters when already running. This flag enables deep linking into content without relaunching the app. See the [Deep Linking sample app](https://github.com/rokudev/deep-Linking-samples) for how to use roInput to handle deep links into content while the app is already running.

Refer to [External Control Service Commands](doc:external-control-api) for information about the ECP input command.

This object is created without any arguments:

``CreateObject("roInput")``

**Example**

The following prints information received from an external device in JSON format. If the external device sends the following input command:

```bash
curl -d '' '<roku_target_device>:8060/input?my_event=My%20Test&x=100&y=200&action=start'
```

The following will be printed:

```json
{
  "action": "start",
  "my_event": "My Test",
  "x": "100",
  "y": "200"
}
```

**roInput Example**

```brightscript
msgPort = CreateObject("roMessagePort")

input = CreateObject("roInput")
input.SetMessagePort(msgPort)

print "Waiting for messages..."
while true
  msg = wait(0, msgPort)
  if type(msg) = "roInputEvent"
    if msg.IsInput()
      info = msg.GetInfo()
      print "Received input: "; FormatJSON(info)
    end if
  end if
end while
```
